I finally decided to pull the trigger in June 2005, it wasn�t exactly a spur
of the moment decision�<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="3" face="Arial">The
idea of a chess tournament in Asheboro had been rattling around in my head for
years, and we had discussed it at club meetings on numerous occasions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Our geographic location in the center of North Carolina seemed like a
perfect spot for a monthly event.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So
as I got back into serious competition in early 2005, the �hole� in Triad
area chess glared at me, and dared me to jump.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="3" face="Arial">I
got my feet wet as a tournament director at The Ricochet 1, a quick rated event
held at the Asheboro Public Library in February 2005.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was fairly successful for a Tuesday night, drawing twelve eager
players.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Scholastic powerhouse
Jordan Wood made his debut there at the tender age of ten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It�s hard to imagine, but this was before the advent of current
scholastic champion Jonathon McNeill, who came along about one year later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>How time flies when you�re having fun!<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="3" face="Arial">The
Asheboro Open 1 was held a few months later, in June 2005.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Our first event drew a huge crowd of 45 players from across the state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>To be quite honest, I wasn�t completely prepared for such a deluge!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Assistant TD Robin Johnston helped handle logistics, along with Mark
Stout and John Davis.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I vaguely remember getting advice and help from Chris Mabe as
well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say, the round
started a bit late!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was much
to my chagrin, since starting rounds on time is a pet peeve of mine.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="3" face="Arial">My
other pet peeve?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>People with pet
peeves�<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="3" face="Arial">The
Asheboro Open II went a bit smoother with 36 in attendance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Once again, I got by with a little help from my friends, and Craig Jones
assisted <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>me to quickly make
necessary changes in pairings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
decided then and there to familiarize myself more completely with SwissSys, and
to practice using all of its bells and whistles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I also decided to re-read the USCF Official Rules of Chess with more
eager eyes, and perhaps a more open mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It�s
one of the best decisions I�ve made as a tournament director.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="3" face="Arial">The
years that ensued have been filled with highs and a few lows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I felt like quitting early on, when we drew just 13 players in November
2005.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This was due to a rookie mistake on my part:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>we scheduled our tournament for the weekend after Thanksgiving!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It seems a lot of players quit chess �cold turkey� that particular
weekend!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="3" face="Arial">There
have been numerous problems with management at Days Inn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We have dealt with noise issues, poor heating and cooling, and on
occasion even some sanitation issues in the restroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Yikes!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I worked hard to
correct the problems, which became at times an absolute embarrassment to me.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>New management did improve our situation somewhat, but never
to my satisfaction.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="3" face="Arial">Still,
we persevered thanks to many longsuffering chess players who have continued to
support the tournament.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I�m proud
of the continuing success of The Asheboro Open, and to be a part of the
resurgence of chess in North Carolina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
I believe our best days may be ahead of us.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="3" face="Arial">Days
Inn pulled the plug on us in September of this year, despite a contract which
ran through December 2008.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was
done to remodel their meeting space, knocking out walls, and replacing
everything from top to bottom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To
date, though, it appears that the knocking out was much easier than the putting
back.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I still do not know when their project will be completed, but
after two months of missed tournaments, the area remains a gutted mess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My initial intent was to wait things out patiently, but the time came for
us to jump ship.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="3" face="Arial">The
Asheboro Open will be back January 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2009, at our new location in
Randolph Mall on Hwy 64 in Asheboro.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chess
in a mall?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The idea sounds a bit strange at first, but consider this:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>we will have our own large playing room complete with a private entrance
and bathroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Hospitality Room
is well lit, clean, and comfortable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
doubt noise will pose any significant issue at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="3" face="Arial">Players
will enjoy the convenience of a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">short walk</i>
to many restaurants, including Chic-Fil-A, Wendy�s, The China Bowl, The Press
Box Sports Grille, Sagebrush Steak House, and more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Books-A-Million also has a coffee shop with Wi-Fi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Randolph Mall features many fine shopping opportunities, and even a movie
theater.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The site is family
friendly, with world class mall security in case any players get rowdy (hah!). <o:p>

there is no separate room for analysis, we have permission to set up<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>tables outside of the main room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
are also many available tables in the food court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I�m not sure about the extent of Wi-Fi access, but it is definitely
available at certain locations within the mall.<o:p>
