        Wadford, NCCA Attorney<br>
        Aug. 14, 2009 </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">In an unexpected
        turn of events, NM Leland Fuerstman has renounced his membership in the
        North Carolina Chess Association (NCCA). I had assumed, based upon
        verbal and written assurances from NM Fuerstman that all issues
        regarding the 2009 Scholastic Tournament had been resolved, including NM
        Fuerstman posting on his website, for a period of 30 days, the results
        of the agreement as summarized in my article which is currently on the
        NCCA home board (“Resolution”) and is scheduled to be<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>removed after August 23, 2009.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">NM Fuerstman agreed
        to the posting of the Resolution verbally in a telephone conversation
        with me and, in fact, did activate an NCCA link on his website for a few
        days. NM Fuerstman abruptly decided on August 6, 2009, to renege on his
        agreement to post the Resolution on his site despite having agreed to do
        so and after having an opportunity to read the Resolution before its
        publishing. In addition, he has reversed his agreement concerning
        member’s legal rights to the financial records, the financial findings
        of the Board and presumably his apology.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">The Board is
        obviously displeased with NM Fuerstman’s renunciation, which is his
        acknowledgment of the non existence of the NCCA. He has requested that
        any and all references to him including being in the Hall of Fame be
        removed from the NCCA website and that his disassociation is total. The
        terms of the agreed upon Resolution cannot be carried out due to his
        voluntary removal as a participant in that Resolution. However, the
        Board must nevertheless conclude this matter in NM Fuerstman’s
        voluntary absence.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">On August 13, 2009,
        NM Fuerstman voluntarily removed his renunciation from his website.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This is a good move and shows his intention to bring this matter
        to a close. The Board agrees; however, his renunciation, nevertheless,
        cannot go unanswered, not necessarily point by point, but in general
        because the Board does not want to perpetuate endless discussion of this
        episode but does desire to draw a line under it and have an opportunity
        for general rebuttal.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">NM Fuerstman’s
        renunciation is regrettable. His contributions to North Carolina chess
        are well known and his departure from the NCCA community is a loss. He
        and I have been friends for 30 years and he now refers to me in the past
        tense in this context. That, of course, is a personal loss to me which I
        take no pleasure in. However, my pole star is to be a guardian of what
        is best for the NCCA and the Resolution was what I had hoped for, a
        reconciliation. The Board leaves open the opportunity for NM Fuerstman,
        even now, to reapply for membership in the NCCA, subject to the
        Board’s approval. For now, the Board, in view of the renunciation,
        considers NM Fuerstman’s membership privileges and other entitlements
        indefinitely suspended. I personally hope that the application is made.
        I also personally add that I have no malicious or biased intentions
        against NM Fuerstman. We simply disagree on the law and the facts, which
        happens every day in my profession, but I do not take it personally.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">The Board can
        validly contest every relevant and material issue raised in NM
        Fuerstman’s renunciation, but we are tired of continuous refutations
        and revisitations of issues completely resolved in the vast majority of
        interested minds. Eventually there is an “end on it”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There is much more that can be said in solid defense of the
        Board’s position, but, ultimately, the Board believes nothing more
        should be said in the interest of peace and quiet - other than the
        essence of the episode - NM Fuerstman agreed to everything in the
        Resolution and now he does not. Eventually one must just make a judgment
        and just stop arguing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial">We hold no grudges
        either NM Fuerstman. I hope you will reconsider. Neither I nor the Board
        want to silence civil free speech and responsible inquiry. However,
        there are more responsible and respectful ways of doing this rather than
        a trial by “flash” publicity. Surely, there are more important
        issues to be discussed on the chess websites - like new variations, a
        particularly beautiful game and reasonable discussions of opinion about
        all matters affecting chess. I look forward to that civil discourse.
        Meanwhile, here is my Farewell to Fuerstman, which I hope will be
        temporary.</font></p>
