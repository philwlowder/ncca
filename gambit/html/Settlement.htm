July 24, 2009</b></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">The Board has conducted an
internal audit of the finances for the 2009 Scholastic Tournament which was an
NCCA sponsored event organized by Randy Wheeless, former President and First
Vice President of the NCCA and Communications Manager for Duke Energy. The
Board’s unanimous conclusion, with the concurrence of myself, Wilder Wadford,
attorney for the NCCA, is that there were no financial improprieties and that
Mr. Wheeless is to be congratulated for a job well done which resulted in the
most profitable tournament in the entire history of the NCCA.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">The internal audit was
conducted by the following committee: myself, Wilder Wadford, the NCCA’a
attorney with thirty five years of experience in business matters, past two time
President of the NCCA, former legal liaison to the USCF, former delegate to the
USCF, many times past President of the Asheville Chess Club, winner of the USCF
Meritorious Service Award, organizer of the Land of the Sky Tournament and NCCA
Hall of Fame member; Gary Newsom, First Vice President of the NCCA, organizer of
the Queen City Chess Club and a successful small businessman, and Gerben
Hoekstra, three term Secretary Treasurer of the NCCA, Past President of the
CMSCA and organizer of scholastic tournaments, former USCF delegate, assistant
to many major tournaments including the World Open and for many years my
assistant at the Land of the Sky, and former District Manager for General
Electric Power Generation. Randy Wheeless fully cooperated with the committee.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">It is the Board’s and my
considered and deliberate opinion that Mr. Wheeless has committed no malfeasance
or misfeasance and that the finances of the tournament were appropriately
handled leading to the greatest financial tournament success in NCCA history.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">A complete disclosure of the
conduct and findings of that audit are included in this article.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun:

</font></span><font size="3" face="Arial"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Background
Statement</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">Commencing March 30, 2009,
Leland Fuerstman made allegations of possible misconduct by Mr. Wheeless in a
number of long articles in public chess forums on the internet, including his
own chess club website and the NCCA’s website.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mr. Fuerstman publicly included Tom Hales as an additional source of
information concerning Mr. Fuerstman’s allegations. On May 5, 2009, Mr.
Wheeless filed a complaint with the NCCA against Mr. Fuerstman for libel,
slander, and interference with NCCA economic advantages and relationships
(contact by both Mr. Fuerstman and Mr. Hales with the Blake Hotel, which has
hosted the tournament three times, and now will not return NCCA phone calls or
e-mails from me or Mr. Wheeless). Mr. Wheeless alleged that Mr. Hales colluded
with Mr. Fuerstman. He requested sanctions against Mr. Fuerstman and Mr. Hales
by the NCCA. The complaints were served on Mr. Fuerstman and Mr. Hales.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">All during May, June and part
of July 2009, I attempted to reach a settlement which would avoid a full scale
adversarial administrative process which could take a long period of time. I
chose to negotiate with Mr. Hales and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr.
Fuerstman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">As a result of these
negotiations, Mr. Wheeless has agreed and the Board concurs to dismiss the
complaints against Mr. Fuerstman and Mr. Hales with prejudice; that is, without
right to refile the same complaint. Please note that Mr. Fuerstman agrees that
Mr. Hales had a minimal role in this matter and was instrumental is its
resolution with Mr. Wheeless and the Board.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></font></span><font face="Arial"><font size="3"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">Settlement with Fuerstman and Hales</b></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">Both Mr. Fuerstman and Mr.
Hales, after review of the internal audit I presented them, agree with the
results. Neither Mr. Fuerstman nor Mr. Hales knew before, but now recognize that
the law does not allow unrestricted demands for an audit by a member. They were
both also unaware of the legal issues involved in internet libel which will be
addressed later in this article. They both say this will not happen again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They both regret having been a part of the inception of this
investigation which led to public internet discussions which went way beyond
what was appropriate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They have
both unequivocally stated that had they known the law on these matters and that
the public discussion would escalate to the level it has, they never would have
been involved in the first place. They both has apologized to Mr. Wheeless<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"> </i></b>and the members of the Board<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></b>for their roles in
this matter and the apologies have been accepted without reservation. The Board
is pleased that this controversy is cleared up. Both Mr. Fuerstman and Mr. Hales
are and have been important contributors to North Carolina chess and the Board
looks forward to working with them on positive matters again.<br>
<br>
I have published two legal opinions which address the rights of members in
non-profit organizations to financial records of that organization and the other
on the law of libel and slander in the context of such an organization. A brief
summary of those opinions are as follows.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">Very simply, a member does not
have a legal right to demand an audit of the financial records of the
Association, statutorily or in the by-laws. See my legal opinion. Also, I have a
published a legal opinion on internet libel which I encourage all to read. Very
important to anyone who expresses opinions of any kind on the internet.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">I have sent a copy of this
article and my legal opinions to Mr. Fuerstman to post on his website and he has
agreed to post them for a period of one month. The NCCA will do the same and
then both posts will be permanently removed.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></font></span><font face="Arial"><font size="3"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">Financial Statement<o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">The Board of the NCCA is not
required to make financial statements to the members except once a year. The
required financial statement is an annual report of income and expenses and/or a
balance sheet. This is clearly stated in the By-Laws and under North Carolina
law it is the only financial statement a member can demand. Members cannot
demand an audit which is what Mr. Fuerstman wants. Please see my legal
memorandum on this for the rational reasons which restrict the member’s
rights. This exception of publishing a financial statement on this particular
tournament is being made only for the purpose of clearing Randy Wheeless’
reputation.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial">Attached is a summary prepared
by the Board and what follows is a detailed explanation of the procedures taken
and the records examined.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><u>Payment to the Blake Hotel: </u></b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Mr.
Wheeless entered into a contract with the Blake Hotel which required him to pay
for the use of tournament rooms. This is the issue of the $4,036.51 which Mr.
Fuerstman as referred to in his articles. This was in fact paid to the Blake
Hotel. The contract with the Blake Hotel specifically provides for payment of
the playing rooms. There are two merchant copies of two separate charges on Mr.
Wheeless’ credit card. One is dated 02/18/09 in the amount of $3,000 which
was a deposit on the rooms and the other is dated 03/10/09 in the amount of
$1,036.51. The first charge was by faxing the credit card information to the
Hotel and the other was a charge added to his Hotel account at the conclusion of
the tournament - normal procedure. There is an banquet check invoice from the
Blake presented to Mr. Wheeless at the conclusion of the tournament and it shows
the credit of $3,000 previously charged to his card and the balance owed of
$1,036.51.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>President Beaman and I
separately and at different times were entrusted by Mr. Wheeless with his online
banking password which shows the activity on the credit card he used. He and I
both came to the total and absolute conclusion that the charges were indeed made
on his card, that he paid the balance off from his reimbursement from Mr.
Hoekstra, the NCCA Secretary Treasurer, and that there were no “charge
backs” or “credits” given back.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>2. <u>So What Was the
Profit?</u></b><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The profit was $8,578. There were deposits into the NCCA
account of $15,111 and checks written for $6,533 as follows: Mr. Wheeless’
reimbursement $4,036; Tim Champion as Tournament Director $600 and Mr. Rogers
for trophies $1,897.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But that is
not the whole story. The actual amount tournament income was $17,817 so there is
a difference in the NCCA checking account deposits as follows: tournament income
of $17,817 less the $15,111 actually deposited for a difference of $2,706.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This is accounted for as follows: $610 was paid in cash to the floor
TD’s and helpers and $500 was paid in cash to out of town coaches as
incentives to participate and to stay in the hotel rather than going to a
cheaper hotel. I do the same thing in my tournaments for my helpers and also to
get certain individuals to come to the tournament, stay in the hotel and bring
players with them - I call them my “boosters”. It is a good business
practice. That leaves $1,596 to account for.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>PayPal was used to pay certain expenses as follows: USCF
rating fee of $387, USCF memberships of $472, Crown Awards (additional trophies)
$120, Office Supplies $65 and PayPal fees of $527 and a $25 refund of an entry
fee. The PayPal account zeroes out.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>3. <u>All Other Financial
Issues:</u> </b>All issues about Thad Rogers' bill, a totally trustworthy
businessman and friend to North Carolina chess, the free entries and the team
rooms are all resolved with all parties.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>4. <u>How Much Money Did Mr.
Wheeless Make?</u>:</b> Less than zero. He lost money on it with time, effort,
gas, food, phone calls, postage, etc. I have run tournaments for the NCCA and
never made a dime. It is volunteer work and Mr. Wheeless took this task on for
the purpose of leaving a financial legacy to the NCCA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Prior tournaments were run by local scholastic organizations and the NCCA
merely collected $9 per player and the local organization kept any remaining
profits. Since no scholastic group was interested in the 2009 event, Mr.
Wheeless decided that the NCCA should run it. This gave the NCCA an opportunity
to boost its revenues, which have never been healthier due in large part to the
efforts of Mr. Wheeless as an NCCA officer and now as a NCCA volunteer. Usually
the NCCA makes only about $1,000 from the event after paying out the scholastic
scholarship and the expenses to the players representing North Carolina at the
Denker and Polgar national scholastic tournaments. This year, after payment of
these expenses, there will be an extra $4,000 in the NCCA account.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>5. <u>Was this an NCCA
event?</u></b> Of course it was. Mr. Wheeless did this for the NCCA because he
is a tireless volunteer. However, it was Mr. Wheeless’ event in that he
single handedly organized the event for the NCCA.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>6. <u>The Board’s
Conclusion.</u></b><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"><b> </b> </span>Mr. Wheeless is totally cleared of any alleged wrongdoing,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>his bookkeeping methods are consistent with common practice in these
types of events, he exercised good judgment with regard to financial decisions
and the Board is grateful for his service.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>7. <u>My Conclusion</u>.</b>
In the legal profession, we have a saying about settlement: if both parties are
dissatisfied then it is a good settlement. In settlement, no party gets exactly
what they want. However, both parties, in settlement, control their destinies.
If left to the judgment of others then you lose control of your destiny.
Settlement mends all fences, accepts all responsibilities, forgives but does not
forget the lessons learned.</font></p>
