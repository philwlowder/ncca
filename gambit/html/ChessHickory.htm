Daily Record -- On Saturday, local chess players converged on downtown Hickory
to play a few friendly games - and to garner public attention in the process.<br>
<br>
Hickory Hobby Shop and the Catawba Valley Community College Chess Club sponsored
a double-elimination tournament beginning at 10 a.m. Games were played at eight
shops on and around Union Square, so shoppers could witness the action.<br>
<br>
&quot;Chess is good for you!&quot; shouted Jack Shaver, member of the
Hickory/Lenoir-Rhyne Chess Club. Shaver was one of several chess buffs gathered
at tables in front of the hobby shop. He chatted with passersby and gave out
copies of his club's newsletter during the games. <br>
<br>
About 15 players competed for a chess set made by local craftsman Bill Landis.
The winner could choose between four themes: The American Civil War, The
Crusades, Musketeers and Napoleonic sets. <br>
<br>
Ken Mann, faculty adviser for CVCC's chess club, refereed the matches. He said
he'd like to see the downtown tournament become a regular event - and he'd like
to see more people become interested in chess. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's a game that, besides being fun, can teach you a lot about life,&quot;
Mann said. After several hours of play, Randy Lovelace of Taylorsville emerged
as the tournament winner.<br>
