<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="1" src="Parrish.jpg" align="right" width="290" height="417">Jacob
Parrish, a 16-year-old sophomore at Grimsley High School, has a unique
after-school routine. He does his homework and takes a nap as soon as he gets
home, and then from 8 p.m. to midnight each day he studies chess.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">He
reads chess books, visits Web sites from top-level tournaments and compares
notes and strategies with strong players. He also works with Mikhail
Neponnyoshchiy, a Russian international master and chess trainer who lives in
Greensboro.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">All
that hard work paid off for Jacob in December when he won the high school
division of the 19th annual Southern Scholastic Chess Championship, held in
Charlotte. More than 300 players in kindergarten through 12th grade participated
in the event.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;It
felt really great to win,&quot; Jacob said.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Jacob
is the son of Robert and Angela Poteat, of Greensboro, and Alex and Jennifer
Maness, of Greensboro. Jacob learned to play chess at about age 10 from his
stepfather, Robert Poteat. It didn't take long for him to become hooked.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">He
went to his first tournament in seventh grade, a small school tournament in
Cary.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;I
realized then I was pretty good,&quot; he said.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">In
eighth grade, he won his first state championship. He attended some meetings of
the chess club at his school, Kiser Middle, helping teach strategies to his
peers.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Jacob
found the transition to high school difficult.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;People
would give me a hard time for playing chess all the time,&quot; he said.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">So
Jacob quit playing chess for four months.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;I
wanted to be cool,&quot; he said.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Trouble
was, he missed it too much. He started playing chess again and set a goal of
competing in the Southern Scholastic Championship. Now that he's won first place
at that competition, Jacob has set his sights higher. He is training for the
high school state championship, and if he wins that he will advance to the
national championship.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;It's
next to impossible, but I think I can do it,&quot; Jacob said.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">He
runs cross country for Grimsley and still plays chess with his stepfather,
though Jacob gives him two extra minutes between plays. He also plays in
tournaments when he can.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Nine
out of 10 tournaments are not age-restricted, so I compete against adults a
lot,&quot; Jacob said.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">In
the long term, he hopes to play chess for a strong college team and is looking
at the University of Texas at Dallas.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Whatever
he does, he said he knows he wants to keep playing chess.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;I'd
love to travel around and play and become a grandmaster,&quot; he said.
&quot;I'd have to be nominated and appointed by the World Chess Federation, but
it's my dream.&quot;<o:p>
