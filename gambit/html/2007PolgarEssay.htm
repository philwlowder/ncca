<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="1" src="jpeg/Amelia.jpg" align="right" width="199" height="300">I’ve
just returned from the 2007 Susan Polgar Invitational for Girls. It’s only now
that I’ve realized there were really <i>two</i> events going on:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">One was a great chess tournament. Some of the
most talented girls in the nation were competing – as well as some who will be
top-ranked soon. There were upsets, tense moments, bad losses and thrilling
victories. Some of my games were on the Internet – although, I have to ask …<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>who else but my Dad was watching?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">At the end of the week, <a href="http://www.uschess.org/msa/XtblMain.php?200708036321.2-12806981"> I finished at 4.5–1.5
and placed 5<sup>th</sup> on tiebreaks</a>. I sort of surprised myself. You see, in
2005, I finished with 4 points and I thought that was a pretty impressive
finish.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">But while the chess tournament was being played,
there was a second event going on, too – and it didn’t get advertised much.
It was the opportunity we all had to make friends with girls from around the
nation. I’m sure all the players at the Polgar had competed in tournaments
before where they were the “only” girl. I love chess, but sometimes it gets
a little lonely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">That’s not the case at the Polgar. There are
friends waiting to be made, and it doesn’t matter what your rating is, or how
many points you’ve earned in the tournament. It’s just great to meet so many
other girls who share your same interest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I had met Ananya Roy of Georgia from last
year’s Emory Chess Camp. She would play blitz and bughouse 24 hours a day if
you let her. We teamed up for the Polgar bughouse tournament on Wednesday and
laughed our way to a 2-3 finish. Thankfully, they don’t have bughouse ratings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Kathleen Coccio of Rhode Island and Avary Bell
from New Hampshire were bughouse and blitz opponents practically every night. In
her room, Kathleen made us try “fluffer-nutter” sandwiches (peanut butter
and marshmallow), which actually tasted better than I thought.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">On a few days, some of the girls would set up a
time to meet at the pool after our games. Every night, we would try to all
gather in the lobby of the hotel to play bughouse, blitz or take pictures.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">At the end of the tournament, we traded e-mail,
MySpace and Facebook addresses. I journeyed back home and e-mailed everyone the
photos I had taken. I spent a few minutes carefully unwrapping the beautiful
House of Staunton chess set all the players received for finishing in the top
half.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Then it finally hit me – as far as chess was
concerned, I wasn’t alone.</font></p>
