<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-family:Arial">It is with
great sadness that the N.C. Chess Association reports the sudden death of Laurin
Keller of Greensboro on Wednesday, July 18. Laurin, 31, was a loyal patron of
chess in North Carolina and had many friends in the chess community.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-family:Arial">If Laurin
attended a tournament where you played – you knew him. He had a booming voice,
a hearty laugh and always seemed to be enjoying himself – whether he was
winning or losing.<o:p>
</o:p>
 We could use more players like him. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-family:Arial">I played
Laurin in my second USCF-rated game ever – in Clayton back in 2000 (a draw).
We chalked up a few more draws over the years – I could never beat the guy!<o:p>
</o:p>
<br>
<br>
He shined brightly in 2004 when he roared to the Under 1600 state crown at the
N.C. State Championship in Charlotte. He seemed to gain confidence after every
round. It was clear to see on the second day that he would not be denied the
state title. You couldn’t help but be happy for him. He used that result to
springboard to even greater improvement in his game.<br>
<br>
Our sympathy goes out to Laurin's loved ones. He will be sorely missed.&nbsp;</span></p>
