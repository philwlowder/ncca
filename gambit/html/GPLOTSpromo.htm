Clarification to Help NC Players at LOTS</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="4">A recent clarification of the NC 
Grand Prix rules makes the Land of the Sky tournament a can't miss opportunity 
for NC players competing in the series.&nbsp; The rules had been unclear as to 
how out of state players might affect the competition.&nbsp; The short answer 
is:&nbsp; not at all!</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Here is the text of the recent 
amendment:</font></b></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">Additional Rules and 
Guidelines: </span></b></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>D.&nbsp; </b>Players from 
other states are not be eligible to compete for NCGP points, but their points 
will be rolled over to the next eligible North Carolina player.&nbsp; If a NC player 
ties with an out of state player, the NC player will receive full points for 
their place.&nbsp; In other words, out of state players will not be factored into any 
point calculations, place finishes, or splits.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="4"><i>
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">This means there are LOTS of NC Grand 
Prix points up for grabs!</span></i><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">&nbsp; 
Players skip this tournament at their own risk, and may find themselves licking 
their wounds later as they scramble to catch those savvy competitors who made 
LOTS a part of their chess calendar.</span></font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Folks, I write this from a cozy 
cottage in Weaverville, my temporary headquarters and LOTS launching pad.&nbsp; 
I guarantee you it is worth the trip to Asheville for the great views alone!&nbsp; 
Land of the Sky gets my vote for &quot;best dressed&quot; tournament.&nbsp; Couple this 
with a reasonable entry fee and great guaranteed prizes, and this is a 
no-brainer.&nbsp; (Seriously, save your brainpower for the tournament; you will 
need it!)</font></b></p>

won't be board.&nbsp; Hah!</font></b></p>
