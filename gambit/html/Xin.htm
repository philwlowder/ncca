<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">Samuel
Xin, a nationally ranked state champion chess player, sits
perched on the edge of his chair, hands on the table, ready to make his next
move. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">He
and his coach, Chris Mabe, are playing a speedy five-minute &quot;blitz&quot;
round of chess.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">Samuel,
12, moves his knight so fast that he knocks over his bishop. Each move, he slams
a piece onto a new square. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">&quot;I
have two problems,&quot; Samuel said. &quot;One, I play too fast. Two, I get
bored if the move is easy.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">At
chess tournaments, though, he focuses hard on each move. With minutes to plan
and execute a move, games can last up to two hours.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">At
this year's State Scholastic Championship in February, Samuel, an eighth-grader
at Harris Road Middle School in Concord, won the K-8 division. But he really
wanted to play in the high school division and plans to do so next year.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">&quot;You
have to get aggressive to aim for the win,&quot; he said.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">Samuel
moved to the U.S. from China four years ago with his family. He couldn't speak
any English, and it was his English as a Second Language teacher at Wolf Meadow
Elementary who first taught him the game of chess.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">That
teacher, Ken Ivens, also introduced him to the Charlotte Chess Club. Samuel,
then 8, won the first match he played at the club, and he continues to win at
the weekly tournaments, often against chess players three times his age.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">When
he changed schools, Samuel got a new coach, and he's had several others since.
His current &quot;chess master,&quot; Mabe, coaches for the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Scholastic Chess Association.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">Mabe
accompanied Samuel and 14 other students to the National Junior High (K-9)
Championship in Sacramento, Calif., March 30-April 1.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">Out
of about 200 kids in his division, Samuel placed 33rd. He is now ranked among
the top 50 12-year-olds in the nation.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">Mabe
has been Samuel's coach for three years.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">&quot;He's
bright, and he listens,&quot; Mabe said, &quot;so he's a really good student to
have.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">To
improve Samuel's concentration, Mabe assigns him a difficult position from a
grandmaster professional game. He gives Samuel 20 minutes to determine the best
possible move.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">Last
year, a tornado interrupted a tournament in Kentucky. Everyone had to meet in
the center of the room, but after the warning was over, the kids went back to
their chessboards.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">Samuel,
who also takes tennis, guitar and karate lessons, likes chess because it's
challenging.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">&quot;It's
hard, and you think a lot,&quot; he said.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">Samuel
said he also likes to play for fun with his friends. When asked whether he
always wins those games, he said, &quot;Sometimes I play stupid moves, but then
we all laugh at them.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial">Mabe
hopes to continue teaching Samuel through high school. &quot;Unless he gets too
good, and then he's going to have to coach me,&quot; he said.<o:p>
</o:p>
