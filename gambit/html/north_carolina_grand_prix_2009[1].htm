<b>The
North Carolina Grand Prix</b> (NCGP) is a seasonal competition somewhat
similar to the USCF Grand Prix.&nbsp; Points are awarded to section
winners at participating tournaments on a sliding scale (detailed
below*), with slightly more points awarded to winners in higher
sections.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Our inaugural
season is shorter, and runs from January 1, 2009 through the 2009 NC
Open.&nbsp; For 2010, the season will start immediately after the 2009
NC Open and run through the 2010 NC Open.&nbsp; Each year, the NC Open
will be your final chance to earn valuable points.&nbsp; This will add
to the excitement of our annual championship event.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The North Carolina
Grand Prix was designed to encourage NCCA membership, and to promote
tournament participation.&nbsp; This exciting series is open to any NC
resident who is a current paid NCCA member.&nbsp; Scholastic players
may also participate by paying regular</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">
adult dues.</span>&nbsp; </p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;">To qualify as a NC
resident, one must reside in North Carolina for at least six months of
the year.&nbsp; Military and college students who meet this requirement
will be considered eligible.&nbsp; Participants who relocate will not
forfeit previously earned points if this six month requirement is met. </span>
</p>
<p class="Default"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">*Earning NCGP Points:&nbsp; </span>
</b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Points are earned at participating tournaments by finishing 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, or 3<sup>rd</sup> in any section.&nbsp; If no third place is awarded in a section, then the
<i>third place</i>
<i>finish</i> will be considered third place.&nbsp;
All winners will receive a one point bonus for each NCGP event they
compete in during the season.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Awarded points will be <i>calculated</i> based on the following:</span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Section Level:&nbsp; </span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Top
Section winners receive the highest percentage of points, 20% higher
than the next lower section.&nbsp; Subsequent lower sections drop at
20% for each level.</span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Section Size:&nbsp; </span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sections
with &lt;12 players get 1x points, Sections with 12 or more players get
2x points, and tournaments of 100 players or more will receive an extra
1x points for each section (up to 3x points, unless the average section
is &lt;12, then 2x points).</span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Section</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">
<b>Payout:&nbsp; </b>the higher the total prize fund per section, the more points one may potentially earn.</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In a nutshell, this means the bigger the tournament, the more NCGP points one might earn.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Prizes: &nbsp;</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Prizes
are not guaranteed, but conservative estimates indicate a minimum total
prize fund of $600.00 for the season.&nbsp; We will offer regular
updates on this projection.&nbsp; <b>The more you play, the more we pay!</b></span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The prize fund is
generated by a $1.00 fee per adult player (and per participating
scholastic player) at NCGP tournaments.&nbsp; Tournament organizers at
participating tournaments are responsible for these fees, which are to
be remitted within seven business days to the NCCA treasurer to keep in
a special fund.<b>
</b>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Default">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Default"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Final Standings:&nbsp; Cash prizes will be awarded in the following manner:</span></b></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">1<sup>st</sup>:&nbsp; 50% of the total prize fund</span></b></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">2<sup>nd</sup>:&nbsp; 30% of the total prize fund</span></b></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">&lt;1800:&nbsp; 15% of the total prize fund</span></b></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">&lt;1600:&nbsp; 5% of the total prize fund</span></b></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">&lt;1400:&nbsp; East 
Carolina Chess will match the &lt;1600 prize fund</span></b></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Eligibility for the &lt;1800, &lt;1600, 
and &lt;1400 prizes will be determined by the average USCF published rating for the season.</span></b></p>

<p class="Default"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p class="Default"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Additional Rules and Guidelines:
</span></b></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>A.</b>&nbsp; Chief
Tournament Directors and/or Organizers may not earn points in their own
event.&nbsp; Any such points will be rolled over to the next eligible
player.&nbsp; For example, if a tournament director won 1<sup>st</sup>
 place, the 2<sup>nd</sup> place finisher would receive those points, the 3<sup>rd</sup> place finisher would receive 2<sup>nd</sup>, and so forth.&nbsp; 
In other words, such players will not be factored into point calculations, place 
finishes, or splits.
</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>B.</b>&nbsp; The NCCA
President, Vice Presidents, and Treasurer are not eligible for any
points or prizes in series.&nbsp; Any designee responsible for
tabulating results will also be ineligible to earn points.&nbsp; Any such points 
will be rolled over as described for Chief Tournament Directors (A).</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>C.</b>&nbsp; If an 
ineligible NC scholastic player wins points, <i>the points will not roll over to 
another player.</i>&nbsp; Scholastic players may redeem their points as 
described below (J).</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>D.&nbsp; </b>Players from 
other states are not be eligible to compete for NCGP points, but their points 
will be rolled over to the next eligible North Carolina player.&nbsp; If a NC 
player ties with an out of state player, the NC player will receive full points 
for their place.&nbsp; In other words, out of state players will not be factored 
into any point calculations, place finishes, or splits.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>E. </b>&nbsp;Weekday tournaments are ineligible to participate in the series.</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>F. </b>&nbsp;Each USCF affiliate is allowed 
one NCGP tournament per month.</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>G.</b>&nbsp; Tournaments must
be Open to all USCF members regardless of rating or other
factors.&nbsp; Accordingly, no scholastic tournaments or sections are
eligible for this series.&nbsp; Sections may only be restricted by
rating.</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>H.</b>&nbsp; If a lower section
has more entries than a higher section, then both sections will be
combined and divided equally for purposes of computing Section Size.</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>I. </b>&nbsp;Participating
tournaments must require NCCA Membership for all NC adult
players.&nbsp; Any player nineteen years or older will be considered an
adult.&nbsp; If an adult player inadvertently finishes a tournament
without paying NCCA dues, this will be deducted from any tournament
prize.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>J.</b>&nbsp; Scholastic players
have a choice of whether to participate.&nbsp; Scholastic players who
have not remitted NCCA membership dues may do so within 30 days of a
win to keep any potential points they would have earned.&nbsp;
Thereafter, such points shall expire.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>K.</b>&nbsp; The NCCA President
will be responsible for determining and certifying the final
standings.&nbsp; The points tally may be maintained by the NCCA
President or a designee.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>L.</b>&nbsp; Prizes will be awarded within no more than 30 days of the end of each season.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>M.&nbsp; </b>Points are provisional until funding is received by the NCCA, and the USCF rating report is up.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>N. </b>&nbsp;Any player caught cheating at a NCGP event will forfeit
<i>no less</i> than half of their NCGP points for the year.&nbsp; This will be at the sole discretion of the NCCA.</span></p>
<p class="Default"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700;">O.&nbsp; The
NCCA reserves the right to make minor alterations to the procedures,
rules, and regulations.&nbsp; The NCCA reserves the right to settle any
dispute arising as a result of this series, and their decision will be
final.&nbsp; </span></p>
