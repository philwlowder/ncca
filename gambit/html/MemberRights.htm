<p><font face="Arial"><font size="5">Legal Opinion: Members' Rights to Audits, 
Financial Statements and Accounting Records </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>By Wilder Wadford, NCCA Attorney<br>
July 24, 2009</b><br>
<br>
My opinion is based upon a review of statutory law on the above issue.<br>
<br>
A member on a non-profit corporation, after giving the Board written notice of 
at least 5 days, is entitled to inspect and copy, at a reasonable time and 
location specified by the Board, the financial statements, if any, that have 
been furnished or would have been required to be furnished to a member under the 
By-Laws during the past three years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Under the NCCA By-Laws, the Board is required to issue an 
annual statement only. According to North Carolina law, the Board of a 
non-profit corporation does not have to give any other financial statements, 
accounting records or to an audit.<br>
<br>
Modern non-profit corporate law favors disclosure, but also favors the power in 
the Board to deny claims for records by members who might use the this as a 
means to make burdensome or frivolous requests to the Board. <br>
<br>
I have been a two-term President of the Association and have decades of 
experience dealing with small corporations. Members of most non-profit 
organizations generally do not do the work of the corporation, the Board and a 
small group of supporters do. The Board must be free to do its work without 
needless interference by members. Board members are, of course, ultimately 
responsible to their membership. If they are not reasonably responsive to the 
membership then they cannot effectively achieve the goals of the membership. It 
is a balance which must be maintained but there can only be one hand on the 
wheel in the Association and that is the Board. <br>
<br>
Anyone who has been on the NCCA Board and effectively held their positions and 
met the needs of the membership in general knows that the power must be 
concentrated in the Board. The Association has a modern set of By-Laws and 
Articles of Incorporation suited to its organization and purposes which give 
that necessary power to the Board to effectively do its work and, in good hands, 
meet the needs of the general membership. </font></p>
