      Raleigh chess stalwart <b>Ron Simpson</b> and South Carolina's Timur
      Aliyev tied for first in the North Carolina Class Championship, held at
      the comfortable University Hilton in Charlotte on September 11-13.. The
      two played to a final round draw to share the prize. Simpson also allowed
      a second round draw to Virginia's Rusty Potter while Aliyev drew in the
      same round with <b>Maurice Dana</b>. The other noteworthy result turned in
      by a NC player in this section was a strong 3-2 showing by Independence
      High School's <b>Dominique Myers</b>, who defeated Dana in round 4 and had
      a chance to catch the leaders in round 5, where he was defeated by
      Georgia's Damir Studen. <o:p>

      to the class sections, where invitations to next year's Border Battle were
      on the line. The expert section was won by Eric Patchell of Kentucky with
      4 1/2.<span style="mso-spacerun:

      playing very strong chess right now, was the top NC finisher with 3, and
      so qualifies for the 2010 Border Battle. The second Border Battle spot was
      won by <b>Ken Baxter </b>with 2.5 Though not a current expert, he has held
      the rating in the past and deserves the spot based on his result. Here's
      to hoping that this inspires Ken to get his Expert's rating back! First
      alternate is <b>Dan Liu,</b><o:p>

      A section resulted in a tie between Charlotte's <b>Alain Morais</b> and

      right now and went undefeated with two draws. Joining him as a Border
      Battle qualifier is <b>Patrick McCartney</b>, who edged out <b>Cheng Chu</b>
      by 1/2 point on the fourth tiebreaker. Next tiebreak would have been head
      to head, which would have been won by Chu, who will, of course, be the
      first alternate.<o:p>
