Chess Club Embraces Young Members</font></b><font face="Arial" size="3"><br>
<i>Charlotte Observer, 12-9-07</i><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">For
those who've caught the bug, chess is magic.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">It
can bridge all gaps, including age, background or language, uniting all who fall
under its spell in pursuit of a winning combination of moves to checkmate an
opponent.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
Hickory Chess Club is proof of that. It counts teachers, professors, attorneys,
businessmen and several students among its members.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Ages
range from 9 to almost 79, and though there is a variety of skill levels, all
are united by the common passion.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">But
the club added a new element of fun the day William &quot;Will&quot; Campbell,
9, and his sister, Grace Campbell, 13, walked in, said co-founder and former
president Larry Robinson of Hickory.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Their
parents brought them over from Statesville because they wanted them to have a
chance to play at a higher level, since they felt they had taught them all they
could at home,&quot; Robinson said.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now
they're a real part of the group, and everybody treats them like family, he
added.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">According
to the U.S. Chess Federation's bi-monthly ratings based on tournament play, Will
Campbell in December is the second-rated N.C. player in the Age 9 category and
is in 69th place out of 100 in the nation. His sister, Grace, is also a talented
player who is moving up in the ratings, and both kids have a box full of chess
trophies and medals from their short careers.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
kids' parents, Dalton and Glenda Campbell, homeschool their children and are
wholehearted supporters of the game, taking them to scholastic and adult
tournaments around the region as well as spending every Tuesday evening at the
club.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;We've
only gone to one-day tournaments so far,&quot; Glenda Campbell said. &quot;We're
trying to stay fairly close. We didn't want to push them too far too fast
because it's hard work, but they enjoy it, and we want to keep it that
way,&quot; she said.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;We
call it serious fun. If we suggest they skip chess club, we hear about it,&quot;
Campbell added.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Last
Tuesday night, Will Campbell was wearing a suit, hiking shoes and a blaze orange
hunting cap when he walked in and immediately took up a game with a newcomer.
Members bring their own boards and pieces and set them up when they arrive so
there's always a game ready.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">In
only a short time, Will had lost his first game, then taken on club president
Vaughn Dagenhart of Hickory, whom he beat. With a second game under way with
Dagenhart, Will then set up a &quot;simul&quot; - chess parlance for playing two
or more games simultaneously - with member Denver Owens of North Wilkesboro.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Hands
shoved in pockets, Will hopped between tables, keeping up with both opponents
and making speedy moves. Soon he had beaten Owens and lost to Dagenhart.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">All
politely shook hands and thanked one another for a good match. Toward the end of
the evening, Will was organizing a three-way simul with Owens, Dagenhart and new
member Eris Allen of Marion.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">According
to Glenda Campbell, her children started playing chess about two years ago with
friends in their homeschool club and were quickly sold on it.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Will
soon got frustrated because he didn't like being beat all the time,&quot; she
said. &quot;He got motivated from that. Now [he and Grace] play some every day.
Will plays with his dad or his sister or sets up games by himself, or sometimes
they'll join forces and play two on one, to see if two heads really are better
than one.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Campbell
credits chess with giving her children confidence. &quot;You just really meet a
wide variety of people with a wide variety of backgrounds, and that's really
good for the kids, since the world seems to be shrinking so rapidly,&quot; she
said.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
Hickory Chess Club meets every Tuesday at the C.O. Miller Teen Center beside the
Hickory Foundation YMCA, and members are happy to welcome anyone who wants to
drop by for a game, including those who just want to learn how to play.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Robinson
- an energetic retired attorney - started the club in 2000 with friend Mike
Mitelman, who has since retired and moved away.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;I've
always thought a town like Hickory should have a chess club, and it didn't, so
we took it on ourselves to start one,&quot; Robinson said.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">After
meeting in Robinson's basement for several years, the club met briefly at the Y,
then moved to Lenoir-Rhyne until two years ago, when the Y's new Teen Center
offered them a meeting room.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;It
was the perfect space,&quot; Robinson said.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">To<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
