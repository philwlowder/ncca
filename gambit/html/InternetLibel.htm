<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="5">Internet Libel or Defamation <br>
</font></b><br>

<p><font face="Arial">Defamation is a communication which tends to injure an 
individual’s reputation as that term is used in the popular sense. The 
communication is calculated to injure the reputation of another by exposing him 
to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or impairs the standing of a person of as being 
honorable. Defamation may be a statement of fact or an expression of opinion 
which implies allegations of defamatory facts. The objectionable words must be 
measured by their most natural meaning and in the sense in which they would be 
understood by those to whom they were addressed. Such words must be measured by 
the natural and probable effect on the mind of the average reader rather than 
subjected to the critical, and sometimes cynical analysis of the legal mind. <br>
<br>
In the context of the NCCA, a privilege permitting defamatory statements is 
generally recognized if the same are made in good faith on a subject matter in 
which the person communicating has an interest, or in reference to which he has 
a right or duty, if made to persons with a corresponding interest. The essential 
elements are good faith, an interest to be upheld, a statement limited in scope 
to this purpose, a proper occasion, and publication in a proper manner and to 
the proper parties only. This privilege is not protected if the defamatory 
statements are made with malice. In addition, where this privilege is permitted, 
then it will only be recognized if communications are made for a proper purpose 
and the statements are not made in excess of interest or duty (i.e., the 
statements contain extraneous, false or irrelevant matters not germane to the 
inquiry) and there must not be excessive publication which reaches persons who 
have no interest in the inquiry, and the statements must not use excessive, 
violent or intemperate language, or otherwise goes beyond what a privileged 
occasion demands.<br>
<br>
The First Amendment privilege of the institutional media is a recognized 
privilege, but that privilege is only recognized in matters arising from public 
proceedings (legislative, judicial or other official proceedings) and public 
figures (any person pervasively involved in public affairs). The directors, 
officers and members of the Association do not qualify as public officials nor 
are they public figures. <br>
<br>
If the internet is the means of publication of a privileged defamatory 
statement, then a special issue arises. The defamatory statements reach more 
than just the individuals with an interest in the NCCA and literally millions of 
people unrelated to the private, not public, interest involved can see the 
defamatory statements. <br>
<br>
The Supreme Court crafted the First Amendment privilege of making defamatory 
statements for the benefit of institutional media and its decisions make it 
clear that these three questions must be answered “yes” for the privilege to 
apply: (1) Is the person making the statements entitled to protection as a 
member of the institutional media? (2) Is the person involved a public figure? 
and (3) Is the speech at issue of public concern? To be part of the 
institutional media normally means, television, radio, newspapers and 
periodicals but it does not address or include the medium of the internet. he is 
a “journalist” and potentially defamatory statements can be made with impunity 
and without legal consequence. The person defamed must be a “pervasive public 
figure” who affects matters of “general public concern”. This would include 
government officials, famous people, or even an extravagantly rich person. Being 
a matter of “general public concern” means it affects many people, from everyone 
on the planet to everyone in the county or city, or a significant number of 
people from many locations, for example.<br>
<br>
Although internet communications may have the ephemeral qualities of gossip with 
regard to its accuracy, they are communicated through a medium more pervasive 
than print. For this reason, they have tremendous power to harm reputation. Once 
a message enters the cyberspace, millions of people worldwide can gain access to 
it. Even if the message is posted in a discussion forum frequented only by a 
handful of people, any one of them can republish the message by printing it or, 
as is more likely, by forwarding it instantly to a different discussion forum. 
And if the message is sufficiently provocative, it may be republished again and 
again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Consequently, the internet is a particularly bad place for 
the unwary commentator to make private defamatory statements about an 
individual. There are legions of lawsuits filed against bloggers or website 
commentators who improvidently say things which harm people and businesses. Free 
speech is important and the internet is a good place for free speech, but it 
must be limited to civilized and absolutely true speech to be protected. It is 
not a place for excessive insinuations, exaggerations, accusations or derogatory 
declarations due to the internet’s infinitely powerful ability to disseminate 
bad information. The extraordinary capacity of the internet to replicate almost 
endlessly any defamatory message lends credence to the notion that “the truth 
rarely ever catches up with a lie.&quot; </font></p>
