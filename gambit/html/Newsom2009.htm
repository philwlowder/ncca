        you all know, Victor Beaman has resigned as NCCA President and I have
        been elected by the board to serve the remainder of his term, which will
        end at the business meeting that will be held at the 2010 NC Open. <o:p>

        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">I
        have become fond of Victor during the time I have known him. He is a
        good man. And as he leaves we should remember his successes. During his
        short tenure as President, the organization showed a positive cash flow
        and now has more adult members than it has had in several years. Kudos
        to Victor and I hope that moving forward we can build on these
        successes. I know I speak for everyone when I say thanks, Victor, and
        good luck in your future endeavors. I'm sure we will see you at the
        chess board again soon!</font><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>

        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">I
        want to let you all know that I don't plan on just marking time during
        the next year plus. It seems to me that we are in a good spot right now
        to move the organization forward. To recall history once again...there
        were some lean years in the recent past when the organization was
        basically out of money. Neal Harris stepped in and righted the ship,
        followed by Randy Wheeless, who not only kept things going, but
        contributed positively to our current financial standing, which as
        mentioned earlier is pretty good. They had the tough job ... getting the
        NCCA on a sound financial footing again. Now in my mind, it's time to
        address some more basic concerns that have come back to the front burner
        after the successes of our leaders of the recent past. </font><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>

        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Here
        is an outline of my sense of what needs to happen and what I plan to do
        about it. I would love to hear feedback from everyone to let me know if
        I am on the right path or if I have overlooked something important:</font><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>

        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>1)
        Events &quot;owned&quot; by the NCCA</b> - Our organization
        &quot;owns&quot; some events. These events are the NC Open, the NC
        Class, the NC Scholastics Championship, and the NC Invitational. There
        may be another event or two that should be on this list. Possibly the
        Girls tournament to qualify a state rep for the national girls' event.
        Moving forward, these tournaments should be controlled by the NCCA. I
        think we've done a good job with the scholastics. It's a money maker and
        I think Neal realized that and made it the centerpiece of his strategy
        to get us back in the black. The Invitational, though not a money maker
        for the organization, is also in good shape.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Moving
        forward into 2010, we are going to control the NC Class and NC Open.
        That means that there will be a bidding system set up (Charlie Carerros
        is already working on a proposed bidding system...thanks for the good
        work Charlie!) and we will accept bids from whomever wants to run the
        events. In general, a successful bid will be one that provides a good
        location and a fair EF to prize ratio. We of course also want the
        organizer to be successful with the event. If no acceptable bid comes
        in, then it will be incumbent upon the NCCA to put on the tournament.
        While on the subject of events, the 2010 Scholastics has been taken on
        by Bill DeArmey and will be held at the Koury Convention Center in
        Greensboro. We are working with Bill Clausen in Raleigh on the 2011
        event. Not official yet, but we are working on the details.</font><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>

        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>2)
        Website improvements -</b> The website will improve over the next year.
        We will have a games database and more pictorial reports from events and
        clubs. I subscribe to the &quot;slow and steady wins the race&quot;
        philosophy. Don't look for one big splash followed by burnout, but
        rather constant, sustainable improvements as time goes on.</font><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>

        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>3)
        Continued Fiscal Responsibility -</b> We are in a good financial place
        and we will continue along that path. We will be conservative with the
        budget but not paralyzed with fear of doing something wrong! While
        building up the Queen City Chess Club I have taken several small leaps
        of faith with prize funds or other incentives that ended up increasing
        our numbers and/or the excitement level at our events. I am not opposed
        to the idea of taking small leaps of faith in this role if it seems
        appropriate. At this point in our non-profit organization, it seems to
        me that the success of the leadership should be judged in how
        effectively we grow the number of members and how happy the members are
        with the events and the other benefits of being a member. As long as we
        have a comfortable nest egg that is not being used inappropriately, I
        don't really see that taking our net worth from x to y should be a
        significant factor. </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>

        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now
        here are some general observations and opinions about random subjects
        that affect NC Chess, to let you know what I'm thinking. Please chime in
        with opinions on the message board.<o:p>
        </o:p>

        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">*
        The NC Open should be held in the Triad area on a regular basis. It's
        halfway between Charlotte and Raleigh. Also an easy drive from
        Asheville. I am not in favor of this event rotating. Adult chess players
        can drive to a centrally located event.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">*
        The State Scholastics, on the other hand would serve us well to rotate
        between Charlotte/ The Triad/ and Raleigh, and maybe Asheville. That
        gives each city a chance to have a feature event to build scholastics
        chess around. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">*
        Our state champion should be the winner of the Invitational, not the top
        finisher in the NC Open. I am in favor of the NC Open being an open
        event, to maximize the number of players. But it makes for a potentially
        random state champ, in which someone who gets a lucky last round pairing
        could win it all. Our state champ should be the player who proves
        himself against the toughest competition. And that is at the
        Invitational. We should still use the Open to qualify two people for the
        Invitational, as we have in the past. Of course this is a suggestion
        that would have to be voted on. I include it here just as a thought
        starter. Anyone have an opinion on this idea?<o:p>
        </o:p>

        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">*
        I would like to ask that the message board be used as a sounding board
        for the improvement of the organization. Now I know that things aren't
        always perfect and people have legitimate gripes and concerns at times.
        I just ask that these be brought up in a positive manner in the spirit
        of getting things right. We have gone through a period where Victor (and
        sometimes I) has been beaten up pretty badly. And in my opinion, usually
        unnecessarily.</font></span></p>
        <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Let's
        enter into a new era where we respect each other for what we have
        accomplished or are trying to accomplish. And let's give each other the
        benefit of reasonable doubt when issues arise. I sincerely hope that the
        message board becomes very busy. And people are every day using it to
        exchange pertinent information and help us move the organization
        forward. Please don't hesitate to let me know how you feel...right,
        wrong, or indifferent. I hope to see more people who have stayed on the
        sidelines get involved on the message board.<o:p>

        I am open to suggestions about continuing the North Carolina Grand Prix.
        In my opinion, it has been of only marginal interest (partly due to the
        fact that we didn't push it very hard after the first couple of months).
        I think at the very least, the formula should be simplified. Please let
        us know your opinions on that.</font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>

        that does it for now. I am honored to have the opportunity to serve the
        organization as President. I will do my best to maintain and hopefully
        build on the successes of the recent past. <o:p>
