Harris: Inspiring Local Students in Western North Carolina</font></b><font face="Arial" size="3"><br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">By Beth Beasley<br>
Hendersonville Times-News, April 2007<br>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" src="NealHarris.jpg" align="right" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="350" height="320">Though
he says it's not really about whether you win or lose, <b>Neal Harris</b> is all
about success when it comes to chess. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">A
longtime top player in North Carolina, Harris has been inspiring area school
students, some as young as four, since 1992. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;The
first thing I teach my students is how to beat Mom and Dad,&quot; Harris says
with a mischievous smile. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">A
natural talent for working with children, a tireless sense of humor and a gift
for playing chess has helped Harris lead more than 20 local scholastic players
to state champion status. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Harris,
a Western North Carolina native who lives in the Bat Cave area, taught himself
how to play chess after a sports injury he suffered at age 16. Ten years later
he was playing chess professionally. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">During
the 1980's Harris shifted from tournament play to coaching, finding that the
influx of European players was making professional chess competition
increasingly difficult. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Despite
this, Harris, 51, is one of only six people honored in the North Carolina Chess
Hall of Fame. He's also a National Life Master, bestowed upon him by the US
Chess Federation. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Life
Master status is granted by maintaining a personal rating of a minimum scoring
level through at least 300 tournaments. Only about 1 percent of the nation's
players achieve the point level required for this honor, according to Harris. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Being
in the Hall of Fame usually means you're old or about to die,&quot; Harris
quips. &quot;That might not be a good thing for me.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Harris
sports a healthy head of hair, which is graying but doesn't add years to his
appearance. Eyeglasses add to the intensity of Harris' presence, which is bounce
off-the-wall energetic but in no way intimidating. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">After-school
chess programs at a number of area schools can boast that Harris is their
teacher: Hendersonville Elementary School, Hendersonville Middle School,
Immaculata Catholic School, Avery's Creek Elementary, New Leaf Academy, Stone
Mountain School and Trinity Homeschool Group. At Veritas Christian Academy,
Harris teaches chess as part of the school's regular curriculum. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Immaculata
is considered my dynasty school,&quot; Harris says. &quot;But Hendersonville
Elementary has done very well the last few years.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Players
from Hendersonville Middle School came in second at a state tournament last
year. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Neal
gives of himself beyond expectation,&quot; says Charlie Snead, principal at
Hendersonville Elementary School. &quot;In several cases he has made a
difference in children's lives.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Clearly
passionate about the game of chess, Harris is eager to talk about individual
students he has worked with who have struggled with chess at first, then gone on
to win tournaments. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Some
kids don't get it at first, then it just 'clicks,'' he says. &quot;It happens
all the time.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">In
the classroom setting, Harris adopts a lecture style of teaching using a large
hanging chessboard to demonstrate moves. Students mimic these moves on
individual chess boards at each desk. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;I
go over strategy, psychology and tactics,&quot; says Harris. &quot;The students
have a chess notebook, just like history class.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">However,
at most of the schools, indulging in a game is strictly reserved for home or
Chess Club. The lack of play in the classroom eliminates kids from being
discouraged by playing peers with greater skill levels, he says. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;I
have parents coming to me and saying 'My kid isn't challenged,' or 'My kid has
Attention Deficit Disorder,'&quot; Harris says. &quot;I tell them, 'Well, chess
is good for that.' One of two things happens: Either chess makes you smart or
smart kids play chess -- I'm not sure which.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">It
seems as far as scholastic chess competition is concerned, Hendersonville is
full of big fish from a relatively small pond. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;It's
really amusing - here we are, small, little Hendersonville, yet we compete head
to head with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg mass of humanity,&quot; Harris says. Area
students also regularly take on students at Durham Academy, a private school
known for its well-funded chess program. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Local
Champion </b><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
top scholastic player in the area currently is Matt Horwitz, one of three chess
playing sons of Dr. James and Deanna Horwitz. Matt Horwitz, now a freshman at
Christ School.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;Neal
has really helped him accelerate his knowledge,&quot; says Deanna Horwitz.
&quot;You can only get to a certain level without a coach.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Matt
Horwitz, who has played chess since the second grade, competes regularly in
tournaments, including the Chess World Open last year. He won state champion
status when he was in sixth grade. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">It's
amazing what an incredible memory Harris has of individual games, says Deanna
Horwitz. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;He
can remember every move in any one game,&quot; she says. &quot;That way they can
discuss past games and compare them to now.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">It's
not surprising that Harris has been named Chess Coach of the Year 10 times by
the North Carolina Chess Association, the top record for the amount of times
this award has been given to one individual. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Girl
Power </b><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">An
unusually high percentage of area girls play on Hendersonville teams, Harris
says. In Charlotte, out of about 5,000 scholastic players, a mere 5 percent are
girls. By comparison, about a third of Hendersonville's 300 some players are
girls. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;We
have more girls than any other North Carolina program,&quot; Harris says. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Good
sportsmanship is paramount to playing, which includes shaking hands with an
opponent before and after each game, Harris stresses. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;It's
easy to teach chess. The toughest thing about chess is teaching that it's not
about winning or losing,&quot; Harris says. &quot;I lost my first 19 games in
tournament play. I could have given up.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="3">What's
more, Harris says, chess is not for quitters. &quot;People say you have to be
smart to play chess - that has nothing to do with it. If you're willing to work
really hard you can do anything you wish in chess.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
