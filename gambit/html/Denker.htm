State Scholastic -- Denker Criteria</font></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Rockwell">Here is the criteria the N.C. Chess
Association will use to
decide who will be the state's representative at the Denker Tournament of High
School Champions in August in Indianapolis - held in conjunction with the U.S.
Open.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Rockwell">The state rep will come from the K-12
Open Section. However, the Denker rep must be a player who is in the 9th grade
or above. That is a Denker rule - not ours</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in"><font face="Rockwell">1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is a <b>sole
winner</b>, that person will win be the Denker rep. Alternatives will follow via
tiebreak order.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in"><font face="Rockwell">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is a <b>tie
between two players</b> – those players will have a match on another day to
settle the Denker rep.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in"><font face="Rockwell">3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If <b>three or
more players tie for first</b>, the Denker rep will be settled by the
tiebreakers used by the tournament. However, if one of the three is not a high
school student, a playoff between the two high schoolers will be used to
determine the winner.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .5in"><font face="Rockwell">4)&nbsp;&nbsp; If the winner of
the K-12 Open tournament is <b>not a high school student</b>, the first high
school player via tiebreaks will be the Denker rep. However, the scholarship
will go the the top finishers -- regardless of grade.</font></p>
