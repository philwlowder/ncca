his sister, now a 21-year-old college student, picked it up.&quot;It just kind
of hit,&quot; he said last week, looking up from the Harry Potter book he was
reading at the Scaleybark library.<br>
<br>
Since then Mu, who lives in south Charlotte, has been to more than 100
tournaments, he said.<br>
<br>
<b>
He finished first in the 2007 N.C. State Scholastic tournament, earning him a
spot in this year's Denker tournament.</b><br>
<br>
Asked to share his secret, Mu said he keeps his skills quiet when facing new
opponents.<br>
<br>
&quot;They get pretty surprised when they learn how good I am,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Family rivalries keep him sharp, too. Mu's sister and 12-year-old brother are
accomplished players.<br>
<br>
&quot;I played my sister once in elementary school, and I lost terribly,&quot;
he said. &quot;That's a bad memory.&quot;<br>
<br>
To prepare for the Denker competition, Mu has spent his Saturdays at local
tournaments. He spends an hour or two a day playing online and studying chess
puzzles, too.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN" style="color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN"><font face="Arial" size="3">But chess isn’t Mu’s whole life. This summer, he’s
been volunteering, watching movies, reading and working out, he said.<o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN" style="color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN"><font face="Arial" size="3">And after Mu gets back from the tournament, chess will
take a back seat to college applications, he said.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN" style="color: #333333; mso-ansi-language: EN"><font face="Arial" size="3">Mu plans to apply to UNC Chapel Hill, Duke, MIT and
several Ivy League schools.<o:p>

I’ll keep it as a hobby,” Mu said.<o:p>
