  Asked Questions<br>
  </font><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"><font face="Arial">N.C.
  Scholastic Championships, March 6-8, 2009, Charlotte<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt; COLOR: windowtext; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">What’s
  changed since last year?</span></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are continuing our K-1
  Section, which was quite popular last year. This was done to keep the younger
  players from being overwhelmed by the older players in the K-3 section.
  However, there are many K-1 players who are plenty strong. So they may want to
  play in the K-3 section. There are fewer trophies in the K-1 section since we
  assume that section will be smaller.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">We are increasing the team
  trophies in K-3 and K-5&nbsp; from five to eight -- to reflect the number of
  four-player teams that normally compete in that section.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">What
  rating will be used?<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="3">Although the USCF rates
  tournaments all the time, and ratings change every day, the official February
  supplement rating will be used. The USCF officially posts new ratings 6 times
  a year. The February supplement will be the most current posting. If the
  player does not have a February rating, an unofficial rating (one that was
  recently posted by the USCF) may be used.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">My
  3<sup>rd</sup> grader is an advanced player, and would benefit by playing in a
  stronger section like K-5 or K-8.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is
  that allowed?<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Yes.
  K-8 means just that – anyone from kindergarten through 8<sup>th</sup> grade.
  Most players play in their “normal” section since the attraction of
  winning a State Championship is very appealing. But feel free to enter the
  section best suited for your player.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I’m
  in the 10<sup>th</sup> grade and rated 1050. Can I play in the Open High
  School Section?<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Yes.
  Anyone can play in the K-12 Open section.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Note, however, that the strongest players will be in the Open Sections,
  so the competition will be tougher.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many
  players like a challenge, however, and usually learn more quickly playing
  stronger players.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I’m
  in the 9<sup>th</sup> grade. But my rating of 1325 is a little inflated. Can I
  play in the Under 1300 High School Section?<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">No.
  Even though lower-rated players are allowed to play “up,” players cannot
  play “down.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your rating is
  over the threshold for the Under 1300 Section, so you must play in the Open
  Section in that case.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">What
  are accelerated pairings?<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In
  order to get a clear winner in any section that has more entrants than the
  number of rounds allows for a clear winner, the TD may elect to use
  accelerated pairings. This pairings technique matches up stronger players
  earlier in the tournament. There are advantages and disadvantages to the
  system. It’s normally used when the field is too big and the possibility
  exist that two or more players would win all of their games and still be tied.
  It’s used in many national scholastic tournaments, and sometimes in North
  Carolina scholastic events. Other than the K-12 Open section, it will probably
  not be used in any section.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Do
  I have to use a clock?<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We
  encourage all players to bring a clock and use it. If one player has a clock,
  it <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">will be used</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>If</span> neither player has a clock, we may begin the game without it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>However, the TD may put a clock on your game during the round.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>If this step is taken, the TD will take the remaining time left in the
  round and divide it between the two players.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">But
  what if my opponent was using all of the time? Dividing the remaining time
  does not seem fair.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">That’s
  a good argument for bringing a clock. The TD should not have to guess on who
  used how much time. Dividing equally is the only reasonable solution.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Also</span></font></b><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span></span><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Players
  should not expect the TD to know how to set his/her clock. It may be
  practically impossible for someone to know every style of chess clock.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Will
  teammates be forced to play each other?<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We
  try to avoid that circumstance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
  later in the tournament, players from the same school may be doing well enough
  (or poor enough) that they are the logical pairing for the next round. The
  normal case is where players from the same school have not lost, and need to
  be paired to maintain fairness to the rest of the field.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">How
  do you enforce the “touch move” rule?”<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .25in"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">1.<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>If the TD sees the infraction, he/she can break any disagreement
  between players.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .25in"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">2.<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>If the TD does not see it, he/she will ask the players involved. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .25in"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">3.<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>If there is still disagreement between the players, the TD may ask
  players at nearby boards if they saw the infraction. If players with no stake
  in the game saw it, the TD will enforce the rule using this information.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .25in"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">4.<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>Player notation may be used, too, if helpful.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .25in"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">5.<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>If none of these methods is helpful, the TD will most likely allow the
  game to continue without any enforcement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Is
  the State Champion in each section only the person who places first – even
  if it was on tiebreakers?<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">No.
  Anyone who is tied for first – even if they are placed third on tiebreakers
  – is declared State Champion. Tiebreakers must be used to award trophies,
  but they are not used to decide the State Champion.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Are
  club teams – or teams from cultural or religious schools allowed?<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The
  key question is “Where does the student receive a majority of his/her
  educational instruction?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
  are many religious and cultural organizations that enhance a student’s
  education with instruction, but they are not the primary school that the
  student attends, and should not be allowed to field a team. The rule of thumb
  is: “Does the student attend this school every day?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Club teams – unless the club is made up of members from the same
  school – are not allowed.
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">What
  are the rules for home-schooled teams?<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Home-schooled
  students are allowed to organize a team if all of the members are from the
  same umbrella school district. In most cases that means the same county
  (Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, Wake County Schools etc.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Although some home-schooled students take classes outside of the home,
  they cannot be considered a full-time student at another school and still be
  considered a home-schooled student.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Can
  a home-schooled student play for a nearby public school?<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>However, there are restrictions. A home-school student may represent
  his or her local public school when access to extra-curricular activities is
  permitted. That means that home-schooled students should be permitted to
  participate NOT ONLY on the chess team – BUT also band, soccer or any other
  extra-curricular activity. As a chess coach, sponsor or parent, you should
  possess a letter from your school’s principal stating that very fact – and
  be able to produce it if there is any question.</span></font><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="color: windowtext"><o:p>
