        grew up in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn in New York City.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I learned to move the pieces at about the age of six from a
        neighbor. My cousin Clive Tulloch and I played almost every weekend.
        Clive was self-taught, and he introduced me to the Sicilian defense. He
        was my mentor, and I learned to think freely with his guidance. I
        learned my first opening from another cousin, Leopold Hall. It was a
        basic King pawn opening, filled with fundamentals. <o:p>

        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">I was competitive and
        very hungry to play chess but there weren’t many kids playing chess in
        the late sixties. I was about ten years old when my mother took me to
        Melvin Brady’s barbershop for a haircut, and to my surprise this was
        where the men in the community played chess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It was like a local chess club.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Many of men in the neighborhood would stop in just to play a
        quick game before going home. I remember many times they would keep one
        eye on their watches and the other eye on the board, while constantly
        glancing out of the barbershop window (hoping their wives wouldn’t
        catch them playing chess).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Melvin and Herman Hacksaw (aka: Rock) had a great effect on
        me through my teenage years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rock
        had a flashy style of playing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
        played the <em><span style="color:black">Orangutan, </span><span style="color:black;
font-weight:normal">or</span><span style="color:black"> </span></em><span style="color:black">Polish
        opening,</span> and Melvin had a solid conservative style, 1.e4 or 1.d4.
        These two men were my chess mentors and friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I learned so much from them. <o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">The chess boom hit in
        1972 when <span lang="EN" style="mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Robert
        James &quot;Bobby&quot; Fischer</span><span lang="EN" style="mso-ansi-language: EN">
        won the World Chess Championship</span> and suddenly everyone was aware
        of chess. Chess went from a fun game to play to serious competition. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I
        was no longer the kid who played chess well. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I
        was a chess player who happened to be a kid. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The
        transition matured me and prepared me for the tournament world of chess.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I won many local tournaments in Brooklyn, but I will always
        relish the memory of winning the Malcolm X memorial tournament in the
        mid seventies. I beat Master Paul Robey, John Evans, and Steve Colding
        to win the tournament. Growing up in New York City allowed me the
        opportunity to play Chess in New York City’s famous Marshall Chess
        Club, Manhattan Chess Club, Washington Square Park, and in Brooklyn’s
        Prospect Park.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I won some
        very nice games against Grandmasters like Joel Benjamin, Alexander
        Ivanov, Patrick Wolf, etc…<o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">The Black Bear School
        of Chess was the most significant influence in my development in chess.
        It was led by George Golden, “the Fire Breather.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I met George in 1973, and he introduced me to a group of older
        men who took chess seriously! <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>There
        were tournaments, chess study sessions, passionate chess discussions,
        etc…these were my best years of chess. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Looking
        back provokes extremely deep feelings for me. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>All
        of those men were like an extended family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Many of them are no longer with us, but in my heart they all live
        with every chess thought I have. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Our
        motto : “The will to win is greater than material advantage” has
        helped me to this day, and its meaning extends beyond the chess board. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>By the early 1980s the Black Bear School was filled with
        masters and experts! <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>William
        Morrison, Steve Colding, Chris Welcome, Mark Meeres, Willy Johnson
        (Pop), Leon Monroe, and the first African-American Grandmaster, Maurice
        Ashley! <o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">I first achieved Master
        level in 1984, and I was awarded the USCF Life Master honor soon after.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I achieved Senior Master level in 1991, and I reached my highest
        USCF rating of 2427 in 1999.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The World Chess Federation, known as FIDE (Federation
        International Des Echecs) awarded me the title of Master in the late
        1980s, and I earned a FIDE rating of about 2300.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">I am now living and
        playing chess in North Carolina. The North Carolina Chess Association is
        a wonderful chess organization and I expect big chess things to happen
        here in the years to come. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I
        am also teaching chess at the Southern Wake Montessori School. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I
        am amazed at how well their system of teaching fits chess development.
        The kids are absolutely wonderful and a joy to teach. <span style="mso-spacerun:
