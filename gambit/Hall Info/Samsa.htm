<p><font face="Rockwell" size="5">Greg Samsa (1956 --&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )</font></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#000000" face="Century Gothic" size="3"><img border="0" src="Samsa.jpg" align="right" width="131" height="200">Dr.
Greg Samsa has had a long reign as one of the state's strongest players, with
the results to back it up. He learned to play chess at the age of 4, and
finished third in a Chicago under-21 championship at the age of 7.</font></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-us"><font color="#000000" face="Century Gothic" size="3">He
did not play again competitively until high school --</font></span> <span lang="en-us"><font color="#000000" face="Century Gothic" size="3">
when he won the top section of his first three tournaments as well as the
Southern High School Championship.</font></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-us"><font color="#000000" face="Century Gothic" size="3">Samsa
is probably one of the few life masters to have attained that title by
maintaining a 2200 rating for 300 games -- all of which were played in one state
against lower rated players.</font></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-us"><font color="#000000" face="Century Gothic" size="3">Samsa
is a seven-time winner of the North Carolina Invitational and a three-time North
Carolina State Champion.</font></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-us"><font color="#000000" face="Century Gothic" size="3">In
large part because of the demands of work (e.g., biostatistics faculty at Duke
University) and family (e.g., 5 children), Samsa is now in semi-retirement from
tournament play.</font></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 100%"><span lang="en-us"><font color="#000000" face="Century Gothic" size="3">He
still enjoys chess (inconsistent results notwithstanding), especially at fast
and guilt-free time controls. &nbsp;An intuitive player whose calculation skills
are adequate at best, Samsa prefers positions focusing on planning and
assessment. </font></span></p>
