<img border="1" src="Leland.JPG" align="right" width="144" height="171">I
don't recall ever playing any chess through high school?! I was more interested
in drinking, fist fighting and kissing pretty girls! I contracted the
&quot;chess virus&quot; just about the time I arrived in Vietnam in 1967. Good
fortune had it that I was an administrative clerk at Headquarters in DaNang
where all new soldiers were processed. I always asked if they played chess!<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Century Gothic" size="3">Most
of the players were rank beginners...but one day, a young soldier with a disciplinary
problem came through. I don't remember his name, but I do remember that he was
from Boston and claimed to have tournament experience!... we sat down to play
whereupon he successfully effected every fork, skewer, pawn trick, combination,
piece sac, queen sac, pawn avalanche, smothered mate and swindle that I had ever
witnessed in one 30-minute period!!? Upon losing every game I stated, &quot;you
are the strongest player I have ever played in my life! You must be a
Master!&quot; To which he responded, &quot;Actually, I'm a 1300
player!!...everybody beats me!?&quot; <o:p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Century Gothic" size="3">Shortly
after I returned from Vietnam, I met Russell Brown (1650), the son of R. Grady
Brown who organized tournaments in S.C. and N.C. in the late 1950's. Playing
skittles with Russell quickly improved my game. My first chess book, &quot;Great
Short Games of the Chess Masters&quot; by Fred Reinfeld, gave me the idea that
&quot;all&quot; chess games ended that way! Maybe, that was a good thing!?<o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Century Gothic" size="3">In
February of 1972, I played in my first tournament. I recall that though I
defeated Chauncy Harmon (1650) in the first round, my first published rating was
only 1357. I bought more books and began to study. Over the next few years I
relocated to Atlanta, Richmond, Kansas City, Boulder and finally back to
Charlotte and played hundreds of tournament games.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Century Gothic" size="3">Finally,
in the early 80's I began to see some progress. The Triangle area seemed to have
the strongest players in the state. Among them were NM David Steele, NM LeRoy
Taylor and the extraordinary SM Greg Samsa. I often traveled to Chapel Hill to
compete against these giants usually coming out on the losing end. But, if you
want to be the best, you've got to beat the best!! Finally, my skill level
increased to 2100+. I remember a very important game whereby I sacrificed 2
pawns to Draw SM Samsa! After that, I had the confidence I needed. Finally, in
November 1985, at the age of 37, I achieved the Title of National Master. <o:p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Century Gothic" size="3">All
of this occurred while I was raising three young boys, ultimately by myself. My
oldest son Mischa, 30, owns FirstComm Communications and has produced three
beautiful grandchildren. My middle son Joe, 28, is the Joe &quot;Firstman&quot;
on NBC's Last Call with Carson Daly and my youngest son, Sammy, 25, is a
journalist/ stand-up comic/ waiter in New York City. <o:p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Century Gothic" size="3">I
founded the Charlotte Chess Club 32 years ago and continue to run the club and
edit the website (<a href="http://www.charlottechess.com">www.charlottechess.com</a>).
Though I don't travel as much anymore, I still compete in weekly tournament
competition as well as give lessons. I am blessed to have made many life-long
friends through chess.<o:p>
