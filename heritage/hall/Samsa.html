Greg Samsa
</div>

<p>
Dr. Greg Samsa has had a long reign as one of the state's strongest players, with
the results to back it up. He learned to play chess at the age of 4, and
finished third in a Chicago under-21 championship at the age of 7.
</p>

<p>
He did not play again competitively until high school --
when he won the top section of his first three tournaments as well as the
Southern High School Championship.
</p>

<p>
Samsa is probably one of the few life masters to have attained that title by
maintaining a 2200 rating for 300 games -- all of which were played in one state
against lower rated players.
</p>

<p>
Samsa is a seven-time winner of the North Carolina Invitational and a three-time North
Carolina State Champion.
</p>

<p>
In large part because of the demands of work (e.g., biostatistics faculty at Duke
University) and family (e.g., 5 children), Samsa is now in semi-retirement from
tournament play.
</p>

<p>
He still enjoys chess (inconsistent results notwithstanding), especially at fast
and guilt-free time controls. &nbsp;An intuitive player whose calculation skills
are adequate at best, Samsa prefers positions focusing on planning and
assessment.
