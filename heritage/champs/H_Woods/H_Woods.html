<p>Our First Known NC Chess Champion -- 1935, 1936, 1938, 1946</p>

<p>
Henry Woods was from Black Mountain, North Carolina, and is reportedly buried there.
Send any information you have to <a href="mailto:chess@triad.rr.com">chess@triad.rr.com</a>.
Anything is helpful, including town of residence, dates, and of course photos.
Since there are many gaps in our records from this period, Woods was probably champion in other years.

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>
Henry Woods was a professor, and lived in Moorehead City in December 1938. <br>
