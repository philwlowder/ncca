1. d4 {Notes by Jeff Jones} 1... Nf6 {This was my first game of the 2003 NC
Closed. I had to take a bye in round one and that haunted me as I finished
half-a-point behind the winners in the u1800 division. This game ended up
behind a pretty wild ride.} 2. Bf4 d6 3. e3 g6 4. Nd2 Bg7 5. h3 O-O 6. Ngf3 c6
7. c3 Nbd7 8. Be2 b5 9. a4 b4!? {Black's plan is to try to create lots of pawn
weaknesses here. } 10. cxb4 Nd5 11. Bg3 Nxb4 {Having a strong post on the queen
side works well too, now black plans to eventually swing everything to the
queenside and try to overwhelm the b-pawn.} 12. O-O a5 13. Ne1 c5 14. Ndf3 Ba6

option although white's position will eventually buckle under the weight of
black's pieces.} 25... Nxa4! {Exploiting the pin along the b-file. The rook on
c3 must move and now black has very well supported passed pawns on the a- and
b-files.} 26. Rxc4 Nb2!! {Re-exploiting the my strength on the open file. Now
black gains an exchange.} 27. Rxb2 Rxc4 28. Nd2 Rcb4 29. Rc2 a4 30. bxa4 Rxa4

seems to help white generate play. Black can't take the bishop since the
seventh rank opens up.} 38... Rxe3!! {A move that cuts like a hot knife through
butter. This defends the e-pawn, and if the rook is taken then Qxf3 puts the
game on ice.} 39. Bg3 Rxf3! {Against cutting through white kingside. If gxf3
then h4 followed by Qxf3 gives black a decisive advantage.} 40. Rc8+ Kg7 41.

1. e4 {Notes by Jeff Jones.} 1... Nf6 {Entering this game I had no success
against Daniel. In fact, in nine previous rated games I was 1+2=6-. The one win
was when he ran out of time against me while having mate in four on the board.
*which we didn't realized until post mortem*. I was happy to see Alekhine's
defense since it was a staple for me early in my chess existance. I hadn't seen
it for years, but hoped that a return to my Point A Chess Club roots might help
me get over the hump.} 2. e5 Nd5 3. c4 Nb6 4. a4!? {An agressive line taught to
me by IM Emory Tate during his brief stay in Chapel Hill. White gains a ton of
space, but has to be careful when he gets overextended.} 4... a5 {The quieter
option. 4.. d6 5. a5 N6d7 6. e6 creates a very wild game. The current move
leads to transpositions to more normal Alekhine's lines.} 5. d4 d6 6. exd6
{This was my first time playing this variation as in the past I played the Four
Pawns Attack. The few times I had played the Four Pawns in blitz recently left
me feeling like I was on my heels the whole game so I felt this would be a
better option.} 6... cxd6?! {The normal move is 6.. e6. This leaves him with
some serious weaknesses on the queenside and gives my knight a post on b5 if I
so choose to take it.} 7. Be3 g6 8. Nc3 Bg7 9. Bd3 Nc6 10. Nge2 Bg4?! {I didn't
care much for this move since it just allows me to gain a tempo with the next
move. } 11. f3 Bd7 12. Qd2 O-O 13. h4?! {I should've played b3 first to sure up
the pawns on the queenside. I can start the pawn storm after castling queenside
since I have a good bind working there.} 13... Nb4 14. b3 Nxd3+ 15. Qxd3 Bf5
16. Qd2 e5? {Now the center falls apart as he can't respond to dxe5 with dxe5
thanks to the queen trade causing the loose knight on b6 to hang. } 17. g4 Bd7
18. dxe5 Bxe5 19. O-O-O Bc6 20. Nd4! {This move isn't designed to get the light
squared bishop off the board as much as it hopes to goad the dark squared
bishop off by offering the f-pawn and exchange in the short term. If 20... Bxd4
then 21. Qxd4 Bxf3 22. Rhf1 Bxd1 23. Bh6 f6 or mate 24. Bxf8 Kxf8 25. Rxf6+ Ke7
26. Kxd1 and black is tied in knots.} 20... Rc8 21. h5 d5 22. hxg6 hxg6 23. Bf4
{The goal is now to get the queen to the open h-file. I could have also chosen
23.f4 but I wanted to maintain the bishop's potential activity.} 23... Qd6 24.
Rh8+!! {A sizzling move that gains a key tempo for white and utilizes the new
pin on the bishop on e5. The rook can't be declined here due to 24... Kg7 25.
Nf5+!! gxf5 26. Bxe5+ Qxe5 27. Qh6#} 24... Kxh8 25. Qh2+ Kg8 26. Bxe5 {Forking
the queen and the mating square.} 26... Qa3+ 27. Kc2 f6 28. Rh1 {No need to
worry about the bishop when you can make a crushing mate in one threat on h7.
Everything is forced from here.} 28... Qe7 29. Qh8+ Kf7 30. Rh7+ Ke8 31. Rxe7+

1. c4 {Note by Jeff Jones} 1... e6 {After a relatively easy win in round one, I
got thrown into the fire with a match against a FIDE Master. Furthermore, I was
battling a sinus infection which made it hard to get over the jetlag from a
crosscountry flight. So I was hoping for a short violent struggle and maybe to
get lucky.} 2. g3 f5 3. Bg2 Nf6 4. d4 d5 5. Nf3 c6 6. O-O Bd6 7. b3 O-O 8. Ba3
Bxa3 9. Nxa3 Nbd7 10. Nb1 Ne4 11. Qc2 Qf6?! {I wanted to take an aggressive
stance here while denying him the e5 square for his knight. The downside is
that I will have a more difficult time developing my queenside pieces.} 12. Nc3
g5 13. Rad1 g4 14. Ne1 Ng5 15. Qc1 h5 16. Nd3 Kg7 {I figured that I've already
committed to a kingside attack and Kf7 witht he idea of walking my king to the
center would be very dangerous, especially with the position of the bishop on
the long diagonal and the two knights ready to spring out on d3 and c3. This
was the lesser of two evils.} 17. Nf4 Rh8 18. f3 Nf8 19. Qe3? {Dooming the
e-pawn to an awkward existance. 19.e4 Continues to build tension in the center
while I lag in development.} 19... Ng6 20. Rc1 Nxf4 21. gxf4? {He must've
intended Qe3 with the idea of Qe5 and is doggedly holding onto that idea.  This
move only opens his king up to further attack. Qxf4 also give him access to c7
which leaves me with a new set of piece development issues.} 21... Nh3+ 22.
Bxh3 gxh3 23. Kh1 {A key to later on in this game is that his king is stuck on
h1 while my king has more freedom. the pawn on h3 is an irritant.} 23... Bd7
24. Rg1+ Kf7 25. Rg5 Rag8 26. Rcg1 c5!! {Admittedly, I played this with the
idea or forking the queen and knight on d4 either via 27.dxc5 d4 or eventually
my cxd4. The fork doesn't work thanks to my loose bishop on d7. However the
benefit of this move is opening the c6 square for my bishop which points right
at his hemmed in king.} 27. dxc5 d4 28. Qd2 Bc6 29. Nd1 e5 30. fxe5 Qxe5 31.
Nf2 Rxg5 32. Qxg5 Qf6 33. Nd3 {33. Nxh3? would be error since 33. d3! takes
advantages of the bishop's recently attained powers.} 33... Qxg5 34. Rxg5 Kf6
35. Rg1 Re8 36. Re1?? {His position is probably unsalvagable, but this
expedites the end.} 36... Rxe2! {Basic tactic study pays off as the two
weakened pawns fall} 37. Rxe2 Bxf3+ 38. Kg1 Bxe2 39. Nf4 Bg4 40. Kf1 Ke5 41.
Nd5 Ke4 42. b4 Kd3 43. b5 Kxc4 44. c6 bxc6 45. bxc6 {Although I had two
previous wins over masters, this was my first over a FIDE master and the first
where I really felt like I out outplayed my opponent. Unfortunately, I ddin't
have the same fortune against the three other NMs I faced, although I did botch
an endgame draw with one of them. I went three and three before the fatigue
prompted me to withdraw from the tournament. It was still pretty satisfying.}
