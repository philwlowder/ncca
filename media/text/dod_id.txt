DOD ID cards are issued by the Department of 
Defense for military and civilians working on a military installation.

Club nights are open to DOD ID card holders and their guests, 
but the tournaments are only open to DOD ID card holders 
(meaning only military, their dependents, and DOD civilians)

Civilians who desire to play in the chess nights can get a pass at 
the front gate if they have a DOD ID card holder to sponsor them
(ie call ahead of time to let the gate know who they are and how long to let them on).  
If they desire to play, they can email me and I will call, but they have to 
give plenty of notice.
