1. c4 c6 2. d4 d5 {When you are playing a student of Chris Mabe (or Chris
himself for that matter), there is a good possibility you will see a Slav.
It's a tough nut to crack and may yet drive me to start playing 1.e4 } 3.
Nf3 { I have played it all in this position...the Exchange, 3.e3, 3.Nc3 (which
has independent significance if Black takes immediately) and this, the most
popular move. This game steers into the "Dutch variation" after 6.e3, which
usually features a struggle around White expanding in the center with e4 and
Black attempting to prevent it or be ready to strike back with a counter shot
when White achieves it. Overall, as in many variations of the Slav, a complex
positional battle ensues in which Black's solid structure makes White's task
difficult. Yes the Slav is tough...for both sides.} Nf6 4. Nc3 dxc4 5. a4 Bf5

Bxc3 followed by ...Nxe4. White has to deal with the threat. } 11. Bd3 Qa5 $5 {
This move is OK and has been played a few times at the GM level, most notably
by Short in his World Championship match against Kasparov in 1993. I don't
think it is the most challenging. To my mind, it seems funny that Black has
two pieces which could be stranded "offside" (the B on b4 and the Q on a5) and
White's task is to find a way to shift play over to the king side where those
pieces will not be effective. Hence my attempt to close things up in the
center and thus divide the board. I think the most challenging move is 11...
Bh5, which threatens ...e5, immediately equalizing. (or better) Let's take a
quick glance a game from another Reverse Angle in which the maestro himself,
NM Mabe, is allowed to carry out just this plan against me. } (11... Bh5 12. Bg5

$1 {and Black is in a pickle}) 24. d6 Nd7 25. Nf3 h6 26. Nd2 $5 {Inaccurate, I
think. This is an instructive moment for me personally. I see two of my old
bad habits reappearing for the umpteenth time that can explain why I didn't
play the more straight forward and obvious Bd2. First is that I am still
operating on the preconceived notion that the black B on b4 is "stuck". As you
remember one of my thoughts early in the game was that I might be able to take
advantage of this B if I can "play around it" Well, chess positions change and
this one has. The bishop is performing an important task in the present
position that is hindering the realization of my advantage; namely it its
keeping a rook off of e1. Misplaced pieces are almost always "dynamic"
advantages that are correctable, either by re-deploying the misplaced piece,
or, as here, sometimes the game just "comes around" to that piece. Each
position should be evaluated on its own merit and preconceived notions from
past moves must be critically evaluated. Things change and they did here. I
always seem to play with this utopian notion that I can play this perfect game
using a minor positional theme such as an offside piece and ride it to victory.
Create a positional master piece for the ages every time I sit down! Reality
is that those kind of games don't happen very often. The second flaw is that I
was enamored with the tactical idea associated with my next move, namely 27.d7
Nxd7 28.Nc4 and I considered Black to be in trouble. Fact is, this idea is
easily thwarted by Black. So to summarize, I was again afflicted with the
problem of not being objective. I've got to evaluate each position properly and
play to the demands of the position.} ({Better was} 26. Bd2 Bxd2 27. Nxd2 {

Continuing with my mistaken idea.} Rd8 28. Ne4 Rxd7 $2 {

Ne5 32. b3 $2 {This move is clearly a mistake, giving another pawn target to
Black. I should just make a useful move, such as 32.g3. Black can't quite
muster the resources to win the knight. due to the possible escape via c5. I
remember being afraid of 32...c4 (if White plays a move other than 32.b3)
thinking that this move would seal the fate of the knight if allowed, since it
"shielded" the c5 square, but in retrospect, ...c4 really doesn't do much.
Black still has to cover c5 with another piece in order to play an effective ..
