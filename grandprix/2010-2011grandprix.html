<h2>2010-2011 NCCA Grand Prix</h2>

<h3>Official Procedures, Rules, and Regulations</h3>

<p>The North Carolina Grand Prix (NCGP) is an annual competition similar to the USCF Grand Prix.  Points are awarded by playing in and winning games at participating tournaments.</p>

<p>The 2010-2011 NCGP begins on September 6, 2010 and continues through the 2011 NC Open, currently scheduled for Labor Day weekend.  Participation in the NCGP is open to any North Carolina resident who is a current, paid NCCA member.  To qualify as a NC resident, one must reside in North Carolina for at least six months of the year.  Military and college students who meet this requirement will be considered eligible.  College students who are North Carolina residents but are attending college out-of-state are also eligible.
  Participants who relocate will not forfeit previously earned points if this six month requirement is met.</p>

<p>Earning NCGP points: All points in the official NCGP standings are earned by playing in tournaments designated as NCGP tournaments (see "Tournaments" tab at this website).  Your point total for a tournament is derived from the point total earned in the official USCF cross table for the tournament.  The NCGP points earned are calculated by multiplying the cross table score with a multiplier factor based on the number of rounds in the tournament.  The following table will be used to calculate point totals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 3 round tournament - multiplier is x20</li>
  <li> 4 round tournament - multiplier is x15</li>
 <li>  5 round tournament - multiplier is x12</li>
 <li>  6 round tournament - multiplier is x10</li>
  <li> 7 round tournament - multiplier is x8.6</li>
  <li> 8 round tournament - multiplier is x7.5 </li>
  <li> 9 round tournament - multiplier is x6.7 </li>
  <li> 10 round tournament - multiplier is x6 </li>

</ul>


<p>Four tournaments are designated as "Majors" on the North Carolina circuit:

<ul>
<li>(1) Land of the Sky; </li>
<li>(2) the North Carolina Class; </li>
<li>(3) the North Carolina Open;</li>
<li>(4) the LPO.</li>
</ul>

<p>These tournaments because of their historic stature and importance will earn double points in the NCGP.  Scores calculated for these tournaments using the table above will be multiplied by 2 for NCGP purposes.  The maximum number of points that can be earned in a single tournament is 60 (120 in the four Majors).  Scores that calculate to fractional amounts will be rounded down to the nearest quarter of a point.  Extra games will not earn NCGP points.</p>

<p>The funding of cash prizes in the NCGP comes from a fee paid by the tournament organizers and the NCCA.  The tournament organizers and the NCCA will contribute $0.50 apiece for each player listed on the cross table.  Players who re-enter or who are otherwise listed twice will only be counted once for funding purposes.</p>

<h3>Participating tourneys: </h3>

<p>Tournaments wishing to attain Grand Prix status must meet all the following criteria:</p>

<ul>

 <li>1)    The tournament must be held in the state of North Carolina.</li>
 <li>2)    The tournament must be open to all NCCA and USCF members.</li>
 <li>3)    The tournament must be USCF rated and follow all rules and guidelines customary for USCF events.</li>
 <li>4)    The organizer must contribute $0.50 to the prize fund for each player listed on the cross table.  The money is due and payable to the NCCA within seven days after the tournament.  Funds should be sent to the NCCA Secretary/Treasurer at the address listed on the NCCA website.</li>
 <li>5)    Participating tournaments must require NCCA membership for all North Carolina residents.  The tournament director is responsible for collecting NCCA dues from any participant who's membership has lapsed or who needs to join.</li>
 <li>6)    The tournament must be held on a weekend; weekday tournaments are not eligible.  Weekend tournaments that offer a Friday option for early rounds will be eligible if those rounds are also available to be played on Saturday.</li>
 <li>7)    Tournaments must be a minimum of 3 rounds and must have a time control of at least 30 minutes on the clock for each player.
 <li>8)    Tournaments must be advertised for a minimum of 14 days prior to the tournament on the "Tournaments" page of http://www.ncchess.org</li>
 <li>9)    The NCCA will be solely responsible for designating Grand Prix status for any tournament. </li>
