Simpson, Taylor, Mabe 1-2-3 in the <br>
2010 NCCA Grand Prix
</h3>
<p>
The 2010 North Carolina Grand Prix recently concluded with the NC Open.
This year's Grand Prix had more money and prizes (thank you ChessCentral!) than ever before.
In fact, when the final tallies were done, the Grand Prix is awarding a total of $1083.63 in cash
prizes and $1029 in chess merchandise! Over $2000 in total prizes are awarded to our players by
supporting our statewide events! Not bad, huh?!?
</p>

<p>
First place this year was rather anticlimactic,
as Ron Simpson clinched the title when he entered the NC Open.
That made it nice, however, as we were able to present him with the "big check" pictured above.
The only thing we didn't know was the actual amount of the check... Turns out the winning amount is $541.67 plus
a $350 gift certificate to ChessCentral.
</p>

<p>
Second place was taken by Josh Taylor of Buies Creek, who takes home $270.83 in cash plus $250 in
ChessCentral merchandise. Josh proves that you don't have to be a master to win big in the NC Grand Prix.
Josh is a consistent player and a consistent winner on his level. Josh's support of our local tournaments is
rewarded here with his second place finish. Great job, Josh!
</p>

<p>
Third place was taken in a squeaker by Chris Mabe of Charlotte who beat out Walter High by 1/2 point.
Third is worth $162.50 in cash plus a $100 gift certificate from ChessCentral. Chris is of course a fixture on
the NC Chess scene. Master player instructor/coach, and frequent competitor in statewide events.
He was the defending champion of this Grand Prix, but couldn't quite pull off the repeat.
</p>

<p>
The most improved prize goes to Austin Liu who improved his rating from 1251 to 1669 over the course
of the Grand Prix while competing in 15 events and finishing fifth in the overall standings.
Austin receives $108.63 in cash plus $50 in merchandise from ChessCentral.
</p>

<p>
Most active goes to NCCA VP Walter High who played 99 games in 26 Grand Prix events!
He came in fourth in the overall standings and picked up a nice wood chess set from ChessCentral
with a retail value of $129.
</p>

<p>
The NCGP had a great year in 2010. Your support of our statewide tournaments was rewarded with this
successful competition. The 2011 Grand Prix is now under way. ChessCentral is back on board.
The prize fund will be as generous as it was this year as long as folks come out to our local tourneys!
Thanks for your support!

<p>I am extremely honored to have won the 2010 North Carolina Grand Prix. </p>

<p>	Chess Central provided a wonderful gift certificate of $350, which
I used to purchase my dream Chess set. The magnificent Heritage Chess set,
handcrafted imported Red Sandalwood and Boxwood pieces, is the most beautiful
chess set I ever owned. During the NCGP competition, I would visit the
Chess Central website and just look at all nice chess things available.
I felt like a kid in a candy store and Chess Central kept me motivated
throughout the year.</p>

<p>	The NCCA also awarded me with a $ 541.67 check.  To all the tournament
directors participating in the NCGP, I thank you for making this possible.
The monthly Saturday tournaments I mostly played in were the TACO, TAO,
Master Trek, and Reverse Angle. Jeff Jones, Tom Hales, Craig Jones, and
Gary Newsom deserve a special thanks in directing these tournaments and
making North Carolina one of the best places for Chess.  The 2010 NC Open
was a fantastic event and a model for future big tournaments in NC.
Gary Newsom, NCCA president & Walter High, NCCA Vice president, and the
entire staff of the NCCA deserves a very big thank you for providing this
quality chess event. The presentation of the Grand Prix awards was a
very nice ending to a great chess year.</p>

<p>NM Chris Mabe won the NCGP in 2009. The last round game of the NC Open actually
determined the NCGP Champion. That memory instilled in me the importance of
participating in each of the tournaments in the NC Grand Prix. Chris and I are off
to a determined start in this Grand Prix race and I hope the rest of you will join us.</p>

<p>	The North Carolina Grand Prix is more than a competition.
Participating in each of the NC tournaments moves you closer to the goal of becoming a
stronger chess player. In the first NC GP event for 2010, The Asheboro Open, I faced
NM Chris Mabe in the last round. He defeated me by simply using concepts from a famous
game played by Emanuel Lasker, in a variation of the Dutch defense. The result of this
defeat caused me to reflect and refine my chess decision processes. I went on to defeat
GM Boris Gulko (2587) and IM Dmitry Schneider (2520) in this season's United State Chess
League. In another case I lost again in a last round game to NM Maurice Dana in a Sicilian
Dragon, at the TACO. This defeat caused me to develop a deeper understanding in the
Chinese Dragon variation.  This experience was also very instrumental in helping me to
defeat IM Dmitry Schneider.  Come on out to these tournaments so you can experience what
I am writing. I am certain you will obtain big improvements in your chess performance!
Thank you again, North Carolina Chess Association, Directors, and NC chess players
for a wonderful North Carolina Grand Prix. I will cherish this championship forever.</p>
