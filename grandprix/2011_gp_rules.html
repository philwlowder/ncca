	<h2>2011 NCCA Grand Prix</h2>

<h3 class="top_25 bottom_25">Official Procedures, Rules, and Regulations</h3>

<p>The North Carolina Grand Prix (NCGP) is an annual competition similar to the USCF Grand Prix.  Points are awarded by playing in and winning games at participating tournaments.</p>

<p>The 2010-2011 NCGP begins on September 6, 2010 and continues through the 2011 NC Open,
currently scheduled for Labor Day weekend.  Participation in the NCGP is open to any
North Carolina resident who is a current, paid NCCA member.
To qualify as a NC resident, one must reside in North Carolina for at least six months of the year.
Military and college students who meet this requirement will be considered eligible.
College students who are North Carolina residents but are attending college out-of-state
are also eligible. Participants who relocate will not forfeit previously earned points if
this six month requirement is met.
</p>

<p>
Earning NCGP points: All points in the official NCGP standings are earned by playing in
 tournaments designated as NCGP tournaments (see "Tournaments" tab at this website).
 Your point total for a tournament is derived from the point total earned in the
 official USCF cross table for the tournament.  The NCGP points earned are calculated by
 multiplying the cross table score with a multiplier factor based on the number of
 rounds in the tournament. Full point and half point byes count just the same as if the game
 were actually played.  Extra games do not count because the players already received points
 in the regular crosstable for that round. When a player re-enters, s/he forfeits any points
 for the first round and only the re-entry score is used.</p>

 <p>The following table will be used to calculate point totals:</p>

<ul>
  <li> 3 round tournament - multiplier is x20</li>
  <li> 4 round tournament - multiplier is x15</li>
 <li>  5 round tournament - multiplier is x12</li>
 <li>  6 round tournament - multiplier is x10</li>
  <li> 7 round tournament - multiplier is x8.6</li>
  <li> 8 round tournament - multiplier is x7.5 </li>
  <li> 9 round tournament - multiplier is x6.7 </li>
  <li> 10 round tournament - multiplier is x6 </li>

</ul>

<p>Four tournaments are designated as "Majors" on the North Carolina circuit:</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) Land of the Sky; </li>
<li>(2) the North Carolina Class; </li>
<li>(3) the North Carolina Open;</li>
<li>(4) the LPO.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These tournaments because of their historic stature and importance will earn double points
in the NCGP.  Scores calculated for these tournaments using the table above will be
multiplied by 2 for NCGP purposes.  The maximum number of points that can be earned in
a single tournament is 60 (120 in the four Majors).  Scores that calculate to fractional
amounts will be rounded down to the nearest quarter of a point.
Extra games will not earn NCGP points.
</p>

<p>
For games played, full point byes will count as a game played since the player was given
the bye without a choice.  Half point byes do not count as the player elected to pass
on playing the game.
</p>

<p>The funding of cash prizes in the NCGP comes from a fee paid by the tournament
organizers and the NCCA.  The tournament organizers and the NCCA will contribute
$0.50 apiece for each player listed on the cross table.  Players who re-enter or who
are otherwise listed twice will only be counted once for funding purposes.</p>

<h3 class="top_25 bottom_25">Participating tourneys: </h3>

<p>Tournaments wishing to attain Grand Prix status must meet all the following criteria:</p>
