[White "Harris, Neal"]
[Black "Simpson, Ron"]
[Result "1/2-1/2"]

1. e4 c5 
{Neal and I weren’t very happy with our first round results and so I don’t
 think we were in any mood to take any chances in our game. }

{Neal played a relatively new idea to me in the Sicilian Dragon. I was anticipating
 Neal would allow me to go into a Chinese Dragon with lots of fire on the board, but it
 was just not to be. Neal has played some really nice games against Sicilian players,
 checkout his game against GM Kudrin! }

{Ok, in our game we reached the following position after seven moves: }

2. Nf3	Nc6 3. Nc3	g6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 Bg7 6. Be3 d6 7. h3 

{I simply couldn’t recall ever seeing this move. During the game I
 thought this must be wrong because white needs to break open the h-file
 quickly. The move does however control the g4 square as would the normal 7.f3. }

{Ok, as of this writing I haven’t found any information on this move
 and only about four games played dating back to 1999. }

{I decided to simply play some normal developing moves in the above position.}

Nf6 8.Qd2 O-O 9. O-O-O 

{I think I was feeling overly cautious during the game. They say once black gets in d5 all is equal.
So, why not play for equality? The game quickly goes through simplification through several exchanges.}

d5 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. exd5 Nxd5 12. Nxd5 cxd5 13. Qxd5 Rb8

{So, now black is down a pawn but all is well. The text move forces a draw but
I could have played the known line with}  (13…. Qc7) {and I think the Queen sacrifice; }
(14.Qxa8 Bf5 15.Qxf8+ Kxf8) {would have been interesting. However, I would prefer white. }

 14.Qxd8 Bxb2+ 15. Kb1 Bd4 

{Looking back at this game provokes feelings of disappointment. I am really having a 
problem with 7.h3. Analyzing the position now and reflecting on the moment
of game makes me realize why it is so important to maintain your creativity. 
What are your thoughts?}

{Neal showed me some lines in our post game discussion and he does have some interesting ideas 
behind this move. But I think as they say; “timing is everything” and Neal’s timing was perfect. 
I hope Neal and I will revisit this opening again or maybe one you will play this variation.}
