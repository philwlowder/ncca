Unique to the Big Enchilada tournament were the special
Jeffrey Schneider upset prizes funded
by individuals and organizations associated with the NCCA.
Over $500 was collected and paid out for the biggest cumulative upset in each of the
three sections as well as for the top two individual upsets in each section.
The point totals were based on the supplement ratings that were used for pairing purposes.
The results were astounding as there were several significant upsets.
Jeff Schneider would have been proud of the winners!!
