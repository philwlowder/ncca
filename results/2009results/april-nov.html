      <p><span style="font-family:Rockwell">Eighteen players decided they were ready for even more chess after last week's North Carolina Open and travelled to Asheboro to compete in the 51st edition of the Asheboro Open. This event also marked the beginning of the 2010 North Carolina Grand Prix sponsored by ChessCentral.


        Current Grand Prix champion, former state champion Chris Mabe came through with the victory in the top section, giving up a draw with Josh Lawson, who is now so close to making expert he can taste it! Lawson tied for 2nd with Asheboro's own Jon McNeill.

        In the Candidates section, rapidly improving Charlie Carerros swept the field with a 3-0 score and picked up 67 rating points! Second place was shared by Praveen Suthaharan and Norm Pruitt, each with two.

        Next up for Asheboro is a December 5 date. Thanks to all in NC for their continued support of this event."          </span>        </p>

      <p class="style1">Jon was paired in the last round with Ashville resident and former state champ FM Miles Ardaman. Miles declined an early offer to split the point and these two warriors battled it out for most of five hours before Schroer prevailed to win the title.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

NM Chris Mabe dispatched of his round 5 opponent early and the ball was in FM Ron Simpson&rsquo;s court.&nbsp; A win for Ron and the 2009 NCGP title would be his.

      Sixteen scholastic players gathered in Raleigh Sunday for some great
      USCF-rated chess competition.&nbsp; The players were divided into four
      quads for three rounds of play.&nbsp; In Section One, a statistical
      hiccup occurred with three of the four players tying at 2-1!&nbsp; These
      were:&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000"><b>Lawrence Bacudio</b></font>,
      <font color="#FF0000"><b>Joseph Sharpe</b></font>, and <b>
      <font color="#FF0000">Jacob Henderson</font>.&nbsp; What a competition!</b>&nbsp;
      In Section Two, clear first place went to <b><font color="#FF0000">Shreyas

      and <font color="#FF0000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CJ Van Vooren</b></font> tied for first place

      April 4, 2009:&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">FM Ron Simpson</font> </b>
      narrowly lost his Champion of Champions Battle this Saturday.&nbsp; Our humble
      hero had just recently gotten over a bug, and wasn't even sure if he would
      make the match.&nbsp; He split his regular games with New Jersey's
      <font color="#FF0000"><b>Mackenzie Molner</b></font>, winning as white.&nbsp;
      They again split the three minute playoff games in the same fashion.&nbsp;
      Finally, one final &quot;Armageddon Game&quot; settled the match.&nbsp;
      Unfortunately, Simpson didn't understand the special match&nbsp; rules going into the final
      game.&nbsp; Ron had the black pieces, and started with a minute less on
      his clock--but with draw odds.&nbsp; While this misunderstanding was
      indeed unfortunate, Simpson admitted that he had missed a good opportunity to
      win the final game.&nbsp; It was an exciting match for all to behold, with
      a large demo board for spectators to observe.&nbsp; We want to thank <b>Ready
      Telecom of Asheboro</b> for donating a rock-solid DSL connection to help make
      this event possible.<img border="0" src="jpeg/SimpChum.jpg" align="right" width="408" height="306"></p>
      <p align="left">The <b>Championship Section</b> was dominated by <b>
      <font color="#FF0000">FM Andrey Chumachenko</font></b>, who actually spent
      much of his time focused on Simpson's games.&nbsp; His 3-0 sweep netted
      him $150.00, and an even greater lead in the NC Grand Prix.&nbsp;
      Greensboro's <b>Josh Lawson</b>&nbsp; was clear second with 2.5 points,
      yielding the draw to tough <b>Josh Taylor</b>, who managed to completely
      lock up a position so that&nbsp; progress was impossible for either side.&nbsp;
      Lawson won the second place prize of $70.00, and his own share of NC Grand
      Prix points.</p>
      <p align="left">The <b>Candidate's Section </b>was quite competitive, and
      featured <b>NCCA President Victor Beaman</b> bringing it from Greenville!&nbsp;
      Beaman had a solid showing at 2-1.&nbsp; When the smoke cleared, two
      players were tied for first place with 2.5 points each:&nbsp;
      <font color="#FF0000"><b>John Retarides</b></font> and
      <font color="#FF0000"><b>Emil Mayev</b></font>.&nbsp; Each earned $110.00
      in cool cash, and plenty of hot NC Grand Prix points.</p>
      <p align="left">There were many memorable moments at the event.&nbsp; <b>
      Mark Gragg</b> upset <b>FM Simpson</b> in round one.&nbsp; Ron had planned
      to play two of the three rounds, but could not complete that quest due to
      his Internet play.&nbsp; (How many would even attempt such a feat??).&nbsp;
      <b>Simpson</b> and <b>Chumachenko</b> teamed up for some awesome analysis
      on the demo board before round three (see photo above).&nbsp; <b>NM Leland
      Fuerstman</b> made a rare appearance, and also actively participated in
      the session.&nbsp; Some new players darkened our doors:&nbsp; Greensboro's
      <b>Tony Sanders</b> earned 151 rating points with a solid performance, <b>
      Leonardo Sotaridona</b> put up a fierce fight against FM Chumachenko in
      round one, and <b>Joe McDonald</b> soldiered his way through his very
      first USCF regular-rated event.&nbsp; On a personal note, I want to
