      <p align="left"><b>Chess Politics Run Amuck</b></p>
      <p align="left"><b>NM Leland Fuerstman</b> has been an important part of
      North Carolina chess for over thirty five years.&nbsp; However, a recent
      post on his message board has left some (including me) wondering how
      we arrived at a place where all manner of civility has gone out the
      window.&nbsp; Is this in the best interest of chess?&nbsp; I don't think
      so.</p>
      <p align="left">It is perfectly legitimate to question the competence of a
      leader, but it can be done is a respectful way.&nbsp; Comparing <b>Gary
      Newsom</b> to a Nazi goes beyond hyperbole, and is an unseemly way to
      address grievances real or imagined.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also
      find it inappropriate to question someone's integrity without evidence.&nbsp;
      This appears to be one point of the said message, to imply that the NC
      Invitational selection process has been manipulated for personal gain.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left">I am closer to this process than most, one might say on
      the &quot;front lines.&quot;&nbsp; Mistakes have been made, but <i>I have seen no</i>
      <i>evidence</i> to suggest that either <b>Victor Beaman</b> or <b>Gary
      Newsom</b> deserve to have their good intentions questioned.&nbsp; On the
      contrary, I have seen in Gary a willingness to step aside to avoid
      controversy.&nbsp; If <b>Gary Newsom</b> plays in the NC Invitational, it
      will be the result of specifically meeting the qualifications, and nothing
      more.</p>
      <p align="left">This statement has been posted with the prior approval of
      President Beaman and Vice-President Newsom, but they neither approved the
      content beforehand, nor edited it in any way.&nbsp; So this is one man's
      opinion.</p>
