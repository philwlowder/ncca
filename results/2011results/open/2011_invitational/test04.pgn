[White "Mabe, Chris"]
[Black "Simpson, Ron"]
[Result "1-0"]

{This was the big game for me.  Chris and I were tied at 1.5. Oliver was leading with 2.5
and he was facing Craig. So, the winner of this game would be in position to win the
title of NC State Champion!}

1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3 b6 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O c5 6. Nc3 Be7 7. d4 cxd4 8. Qxd4

{Ok, I think we were both happy to be in this position. However, I think Chris had a
better feel for this position than I did.
I was struggling with piece placement and timing. I really didn't want to play Nc6,
because I thought the knight would be missed placed. So the correct way to play this opening
position can be found in doing some research in the English Opening: Symmetrical Variation.
Hedgehog Defense.
One very interesting game that is worth reviewing is Vladimir Kramnik vs Peter Leko,
Budapest RWE Gas m 2001.
I have played this opening many times before but I was unable to recall any of the specifics.
My next few moves show that I was struggling with the fine points of this position.}

8... d6 9. Bg5 h6 

{My 9... h6 is actually the beginning of my problems. I really didn't expect 9.Bg5
and all of my thoughts on the position where thrown to the side because of 9.Bg5.
I failed to see why white would want to trade his bishop for my knight.
I felt white was wrong and I wanted to force him to justify the Bishop move now, thus, 9.h6.
Ok, this is a weakness in my game. I had a good handle on how I wanted to continue
regarding 8...d6. I was planning to develop my Queen Knight to d7, castle, a6,
etc... typical hedgehog type development. But I was now completely distracted by 9... Bg5.
I wish I could tell you that Chess performance is all about chess moves and chess knowledge.
But as you can see my h6 wasn't based on a continuous thought. 9... h6 was a reaction to a move
I felt was wrong. I believe I reacted on an emotional level. Think about when you are having a
serious conversation with someone and they say something which provokes your emotions. A typical
response might be to blurt out an emotional statement. In chess you can't change your response,
you must live with it. In conversation you may be able to fix your emotional response
with an apology or rephrasing the outburst. But this is Chess and so I must now live
with the following position:}

10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. Qf4 

{Now I am really upset with my play and the above position. Chris now has the easier position
to play. Remember I didn't want to play Nc6 and I wanted to play it to d7. My thoughts are
filled with negative feelings regarding what I did on move nine and the compromises I now need to make.

Objectively I don't think I am lost. My position isn't that bad but it is far from good.
I know from experience that I need to clear my head of all unproductive thoughts. The
past is the past and the future depends on the present. I need to assess this position
correctly and play focused.

The lesson to learn is; "stay in the moment". Focus on what is in front of you.
Listen to the position and respond based on your understanding of the position. Don't allow
distractions to guide your thoughts away from your understanding of the position.}

Bxc3 12.bxc3 Qc7 13. Rfd1 Ke7 

{Ok, many of you are probably wondering why didn't black castle and protect his King?
All of my calculations indicated that my King was fine in the center. This may sound
funny or overly optimistic on my part. But I simply don't believe in making moves because
that's "what they say you should do". Now in our post game analysis Neal pointed out that 14.Qh4+
looked good for white and exposes the weakness of my King move. I must say I think Neal
was correct. In the game I calculated that I would be fine in that variation but I now think I was wrong.

Chris had other plans!!}

14. Rxd6

{Wow!! I didn't think this was possible. I just protected this square with my King. 
Ok my thoughts were "Chris is a monster!". I must have spent a few minutes internally
recognizing his courage, boldness, complete disregard of fear.
I needed a moment because I felt like a boxer who just got knocked down with 
an upper cut.
So just like in my game with Craig Jones it was time to become stoic and
just analyze everything!}

14... Qxd6 15. Ne5 Bxg2 16. Qxf7+ Kd8 17. Qxg7 Qf8 18. Rd1+ Kc8 19. Qg4 

{Now I think Chris is lost!!
I am up two pieces but I do have some problems which require accurate analysis.
Emotions are going wild. Can I save the Bishop? No, I can't play Bb7 because after Qxe6+ I am done. 
So what about attacking his knight? Qf6 or Qf5.? 
Ok, I think it is safe to say white is fighting back.
I picked 19... Qf6 over Qf5. I think I was wrong. }

19... Qf6 20. Kxg2 a6 21. Rd6

{I saw this position developing and I thought I could play Qxe5.
But it wasn't that easy and I focused on the following:
21... Qxe5 22.Rxe6 Qg5 23.Re8+ Kg7 24.Qc8+ Ka7 25.Qc7
mate. I am now feeling the stress of the game.
White is down a rook but he has play! I need to coordinate my pieces, but how?}

21... Re8

(21... Qxe5 22.Rxe6 Qg5 23.Re8+ Kb7 24.Qc8+ Ka7 25.Qc7#)

22. Qe4 Ra7 23. Rxb6

{The pressure simply broke me down and I blundered with the next move.
I must say this game was painful to lose because I was up a piece, a rook for a few pawns. }

23... Rc7? 24.Qa8 Qxe5 25. Rxb8+ Kd7 26. Rxe8 Qxe2 27. c5 Qe5 28. c6+ Kd6 29. Rd8+ Kc5 30.
Rd4 Qe2 31. Qf8+ Kxc6 32. Qb4 Qe5 33.a4 Rc8 34.a5 

{In conclusion, I think Chris played courageously and when faced with defeat 
he maintained active play requiring me to be precise. I certainly look 
forward to our next game.}
