<h4>LM Chis Mabe wins TAO 60</h4>

<p>
"I'm not sure what it is about 33 players, but we seem to draw that number every month!
Our goal is to average 36 players, or three dozen (either will do).
Asheboro turned into chess talent central for our Dog Day Event, however, with former NC Champions
LM Chris Mabe and FM Ron Simpson headlining.
The Championship Section was so strong that last month's Grand Champion Kevin Chen found himself exiled to the
Candidate's Section, which he won handily."</p>

<h4>Myers has the “Right Angle”</h4>

<p>
A grand total of 65 players ascended on the Cone Center at UNC-Charlotte for the 19th running of the Reverse Angle tournament series. When the last pawn was pushed, recent Charlotte high school graduate ( and soon to be Liberty College freshman ) Dominique Myers came through with the only perfect score in the top section, defeating SC chess icon Klaus Pohl in the last round.
</p>
<p>
In the U1800 section, a three way tie ensued among the QCCA’s Mike Eberhardinger and Mark Biernacki, along with Zachary High of Chapel Hill.
</p>
<p>
North Carolinians John Xia and Andrew Austin both came through with perfect scores in the U1400.
</p>
<p>
The U1100 was won by Nicholas Miklaucic with a 3-0 score. Ishaan Maitra and James Chapman tied for 2nd with 2.5.
</p>
<p>
A grand total of $1040 in cash prizes was awarded. In addition, the QCCA gave a free entry to the NC Open to the winner (on tiebreaks if necessary). With this the QCCA gave away exactly 100% of entries in prizex. The entry fees were won by Dominique Myers, Mike Eberhardinger, John Xia and Nick Miklaucic.

<p>
33 players entered TACO LXIV on July 17th, 2010 at Caraleigh Fellowship Hall in Raleigh.
</p>

<p>
The Open table saw Adam Holmes and Oliver Fernando enter and even endgame on the top board in the last round. The game ended in a draw and pushed Holmes to his sixth TACO title, making him third in series history behind FM Ron Simpson and NM John Bidwell. Fernando joined Felix McCain among the ranks of recent first-time player winners of a TACO.
</p>

<p>
William LeFew claimed his second straight U1800 section title with a clear first 2½-point effort.
</p>

<p>
Once again the U1400 saw two players share top honors as Andrew Austin went 3-0 for the second straight TACO. Michael Fussell joined him with the tournament's only perfect score.
</p>

<p>
Jeff Jones served as chief TD on behalf of the Raleigh Tournament Chess Club, with Dr. Walter High serving as assistant director.

"Turnout this month was average at 33 players, but the talent on hand was far from average.
It was a special treat to see NM Robin Cunningham in action at his first Asheboro Open.
Once one of North Carolina's top players, Robin currently resides in California with his family.
The top section was top-heavy with talent, and an average rating of over 1900.
These included NM Dan Liu, a former NC Champion, and Charlotte Expert Patrick McCartney.
I would be remiss if I didn't mention longsuffering James Watson, who we shall refer to henceforth
as NM James Watson.  For more on this, enter the <a href="http://asheborochess.com/MarqueeChamp.htm">Asheboro Hall of Champions</a>.
Last but not least, we were honored to host Statesville's Statesman of Chess Mike Williams,
a strong player and fine addition to our lineup."

</ul>

<p>Thirty-Four players converged on south Raleigh for TACO LXIII on 26 June, 2010. The fourteen-player "En Fuego" section saw quite a few surprises as the top two boards were draws in each of the first two rounds. The final round was more decisive as FM Ron Simpson, Adam Holmes, and Eugene Cloete each were victorious in their final round games to share first prize.</p>
<p>The nine-player "Picante" section  saw the only clear winner as William Lefew emerged as the winner despite spotting the field with a first-round bye. Gary Maltzman, Michale Tedder, and Kevin Tie all split second.</p>
<p>With eleven participants, the "Moderado" section witnessed two perfect scores with Derek Shepherd and Andrew Austin conquering all of their opponents.</p>
<p>TACO LXIV will be July LXIV. In the meantime you can join the Raleigh Tournament Chess Club on Wednesday nights at the McDonald's off exit 291 of I-40 (about 3/4 miles from the exit.)</p>

<h4>FM Ron Simpson continued his domination in Asheboro</h4>

<p>
"FM Ron Simpson continued his domination in Asheboro this month, surviving a fierce Smith-Morra Gambit by James Watson in
round three which nearly toppled his king.  (According to Deep Rybka 4, Watson missed a decisive continuation during his brutal onslaught).
The former NC Champion earned $140.00 for his efforts.  As usual, Ron spent a good deal of time analyzing his own games,
and helping others with theirs.  Fayetteville's Paul King was undefeated after a half point bye for round one, earning clear
second place and $65.00 worth of respect.  Friend Larry Williams was awarded the $35.00 class prize with a solid 2-0 showing,
despite a second round rook sac by Reynaldo Diaz that "swindled" him out of a clear win.
Always a gentleman, Larry laughed it off and continued to play well."

<p>
"A small but vibrant crowd of 24 players competed in the Statesville Skewer 2, held 6/19/2010 at Shiloh United Methodist Church  in Statesville NC. Young and old, beginner and master and all skill levels in between, put their skills to the test in pursuit of cash or trophies."
</p>
<p>
"Chris Mabe started out by winning a red knight bag-tag in the door prize drawing. Perhaps being "up a knight" before the round began was an omen of things to come, as he won clear first place in the Alpha Section with a 2.5/3 score ($50)."

<h4>RON SIMPSON TAKES THE N.C. CLASS OPEN TITLE</h4>

<p>Ron Simpson definitely had “Georgia on his mind” as he survived an onslaught of highly rated players from Georgia to win the Open section of the North Carolina Class Championship on Sunday, June 6, 2010.  Simpson finished with 4.5/5.0 and his last three games were against the Georgians.  He beat Donnie Gray (2130), drew Damir Studen (2232), then clinched the title with a big win over Gabriel Battiglini (2427).  Studen and Gray tied for 2nd place with 4.0 and North Carolina’s Chris Mabe took clear 4th with 3.5.  NCCA President Gary Newsom, Patrick McCartney, and Shawn McIntosh all finished with 3.0 to tied Battiglini for 5th place.</p>
<p>Tianqi Wang rolled through the A section with a 4.5 score, making it look easy as he demolished the competition.  Only the return of Thomas Paradis dented his attempt at a perfect score as Paradis fought him to a draw.  Paradis was playing his first rated tournament since April of 2009, but he shook off the rust quickly to score 3.5 and tie Steve Abrahams and Henry White for 2nd place.  Although Paradis had not played since he finished high school, he got through the tournament without a loss as two wins and three draws attested to his fortitude.</p>
<p>Another Georgian, Reece Thompson, took the B section with 4.5.  His attempt at a perfect score was interrupted by North Carolina’s Ken Chu, a Charlotte 6th grader, who managed a draw.  Chu’s rating is skyrocketing as he took clear 2nd with 4.0 and jumped well into the 1700s with a new rating of 1739.</p>
<p>Another major rating leap was accomplished by Jordan Eliseo in the C section as he scored 4.5.  His only blemish was a loss to Michael Tedder in the last round.  Eliseo’s rating went from 1405 to 1570.  Adam Shaw and Bradley Fowler tied for second with 3.0 scores.</p>
<p>Shouri Gottiparthi won Class D with 4.0 and Tony Cato won Class E with 4.5.  The only perfect score in the tournament was Class E victor Prabhath Kotha with his 5.0.</p>
<p>Everyone seemed to enjoy playing and having time to chat between rounds with their competitors.  The presence of eight players from Georgia gave a challenge to the North Carolinians and made the tournament more interesting.  Over the past several years, many more scholastic competitors have begun playing in the “adult” tournaments and the results are quite evident.  The tougher competition has been good for both adults and kids and the quality of scholastic play has increased tremendously in North Carolina.  The state is on the verge of having an onslaught of expert level scholastic players after years of only one or two at most.  Josh Mu and Samuel Xin could quickly be joined by the likes of Will Campbell, Tianqi Wang, Kevin Huang, Allan Jiang, Robin Yopp, and David Spencer.  Among this candidate group only Huang will be a senior next year. Mu and Xin who are already at the expert level will be in the 10th and 11th grades respectively.</p>
