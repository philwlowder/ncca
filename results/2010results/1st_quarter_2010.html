<h2>NC Girls State Championships - 27 March 2010</h2>

<p>
 Girls from all over the state of North Carolina came to Charlotte's Myers
Park Traditional Elementary school to play for a $500 Scholarship to college
and 20 trophies and medals.  We broke last year's record of 32 with 46
girls!  This is so great.  Clearly we can get more to play, but the turnout
was much better this year.  Check out our photos to see your young ladies in
action over the chessboard!  Charlotte was most represented, but Durham,
Boone, Asheville, Wilson, and Winston-Salem among other cities were also
present.  We were so lucky to have Laura Lee, number one ranked woman in NC,
join us for an inspiring speech and game review to start our day.  Ms Lee
currently teaches chess at CYCC on weekends while also going to college.

<p>
The top section was very difficult.  We were fortunate to have Rifeng Xia
(Wendy) a 1900 FIDE rated exchange student play in the top section, along
with 1700+ rated girls:  Brittney DeWitt, Indira Puri (last year's winner),
and Grace Campbell.  The section included 14 players with most over 1000 and
several brave u1000 girls.  The u600 players had more than 30 participants,
many of whom especially appreciated the face painting, and many more who
along with the fun will likely have to compete in the Championship section
next year.

1st place Winners:   In the top section:  Grace Campbell with 3.5 out of 4
wins the $500 scholarship to college!  This is just one month after her
brother Will Campbell won the 1st place scholarship at the NC State
Scholastics amongst high schoolers!  Go Campbells!!
In the U600 Section, Jesse Coward and Lily Burdick both went 4 and 0, and
Jesse won on tiebreaks!  Impressive! Complete results will be up on the
USCF <http://www.uschess.org> soon.  This tournament would not have been as punctual or fun without the
help of Bill DeArmey who helped TD the floor, and Sarah Sauer and the other
moms who painted faces between rounds.  Thank to you to all volunteers and
parents who support women's chess!  It takes a village, as they say...

<h2>TACO LX - 20 March 2010</h2>

<p>Despite missing several regulars, a healthy turnout of twenty-seven players converged on
south Raleigh for TACO LX on March 20th, 2010. With only three entries in the top section,
it was merged with the under 1800 section to form an 18-player section.
Scott Baldwin and Stephen Forest shared first with two and a half points.
(It should be noted that there were no perfect scores going into the final round
thanks to accelerated pairings and a number of draws.)

Jeff Jones and jon Achelpohl served as co-TDs on behalf of the Raleigh Tournament Chess Club.</p>

<p>
His 5-0 score included two key victories on Sunday. First he defeated defending champ David High.
He followed that by defeating Eric Noden, an eighth grader
who had quite a tournament himself and was 4-0 going into this final round match up.
Will wins the $1500 scholarship, but because he is not yet a
 high school student, he doesn't qualify for the Denker High School
 Tournament of Champions. That honor goes to 9th grader Joshua Mu, who came
 in clear second with a 4 1/2 score. A grand total of 452 players competed
 for the titles and the hardware. More to come soon on this event.

<p>
A grand total of 77 players braved the early winter chill and converged
on the campus of UNCC Charlotte to compete in the Greater Charlotte
Championship, held on December 5-6. Four masters were present to compete
for the guaranteed $2400 prize fund, headed by FM Ron Simpson of
Raleigh. He was joined by NM Chris Mabe of Charlotte, NM Phillip Lamby
of Columbia, SC, and NM Klaus Pohl of Greeneville, SC.

The Open Section was won by FM Simpson and NM Mabe who came in with 4-1
scores. Third place was won by Charlotte high schooler Dominique Myers,
whose 3.5 score included sending Mabe to his only defeat of the event.
The U2000 prize was won by Patrick McCartney with 3 points. Also
noteworthy was the performance of Mladen Pauler, a Charlottean by way
of Bosnia, who just last week played his first USCF rated game at the
Queen City Chess Club. He also came in with 3 points.
</p>


<p align="left">In the U1800 section, Charlotte's JP Flynn and Greensboro's Reynaldo
Diaz agreed to a hard fought last round draw and tied for 1st with 4-1.
Third place was shared between two Charlotte youth; Ken Chu and Joe
Biernacki. The Under 1600 prize was a tie with Ben Blair and Jonathan
Sarasua sharing the honors.

  The U1400 Section saw the only clear winner with Norm Pruitt continuing
his recent winning ways by cruising to a 4.5 score. Second place was a
tie between Praveen Suthaharan of Greensboro and Windy Gatlin of
Charlotte. Michael Boone won the U1200 prize with a 3.5 score. All the
adult sections were directed by the tag team of STD Tim Champion and
CTD Wing Chu.

   In the scholastics section, Lloyd Liu won the K-12 division and Eddie
Lancaster prevailed in the K-4 section. The scholastic was directed by
LTD Fabio Hurtado.
</p>

 As advertised the tournament paid out the guaranteed $2400 prize fund
plus gave out 10 nice trophies in the scholastics section. The numbers
didn't allow us to break even, but we at Queen City Chess were very
proud of the event and will be happy to put it on again next year. It
combined great playing conditions, fantastic competition, and a high
level of sportsmanship and camaraderie. And that is what amateur chess
is all about.
</p>

   In addition, this event accomplished something that was envisioned when
the QCCA began. A system has been put in place to determine an official
yearly champion of the Charlotte metro area. Six players qualified from
this event to compete in a round robin for the title of "Greater
Charlotte Champion". The players were NM Chris Mabe, Dominique Myers,
Gary Newsom, Patrick McCartney, Mladen Pauler, and Dan Liu. This event
will be contested on consecutive Tuesday nights in February at the
Queen City Chess Club's weekly meeting.

<p>
In an exciting finish that went down to the last game, Charlotte NM Chris Mabe has won
the 2009 North Carolina Grand Prix, taking home a check of over $400! The Grand Prix came down
to the final event, the NC Open. Chris needed to place in the points and ahead of Raleigh
NM Ron Simpson in order to win. Needing a last round win against Expert David Erb in order
to clinch the Grand Prix for himself, Ron fought valiantly to win but David was up to the
challenge and held the draw in a complex ending.</p>

The Under 1800 prize was won by Brian Moore. Under 1600 was taken by Kevin Chen,
and the Under 1400 prize was won by William LeFew. (Please send your mailing addresses
to <a href="mailto:gary.newsom@queencitychess.com">gary.newsom@queencitychess.com</a> and I
will send out the checks.) So ends a successful first year of the Grand Prix. With the changes
in points calculation to level the playing field; and our new sponsorship with ChessCentral,
look for the 2010 Grand Prix to be even bigger and better.</p>
